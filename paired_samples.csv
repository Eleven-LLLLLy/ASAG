The first is that part-time jobs are a valuable way to see how what students have learnt in class applies in the real world. Classroom education, especially at the university level, tends to be academic and theory-oriented. There is often little opportunity to see how these theories apply in practical usage. A part-time job in the same field as the student's degree will allow them to learn from professionals who apply these concepts on a daily basis. This will be a useful contrast from university classes, which are almost always taught by researchers. The second benefit of obtaining part-time employment alongside higher education is that it gives the student opportunities to pick up skills that they will need later when they enter the workforce, but are not taught in traditional university curricula. These include interpersonal skills and effective communication. University education is primarily designed to test whether the theoretical concepts taught have been learnt with sufficient clarity. When students enter the workforce, however, they often need to apply these concepts in concert with their colleagues. This will require them to communicate effectively and clearly. A part-time job will definitely give them an opportunity to exercise and improve this set of skills.""]"

Many times it's hard for us to say who is right or who is wrong. But in social opinion, also in my opinion, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. Firstly, having part-time jobs to support college students' life in college can reduce their parents' financial burden. Our parents are no longer giving money to us or give less money to us. It can save the whole family's expenses. Secondly, having part-time jobs can develop our ability. If we have a part-time job, we will know the society or interpersonal relationship better, and we may make friends with more people. It's useful for our future work. In other words we can prepare for our future. In a word, working opens our eyes. Finally, using the money that earned by ourselves, will make us feel great. We all know that food made by ourselves tastes more delicious, the house built by ourselves live more comfortable. As the same way, the money earned by ourselves spends more fulfilling.

But, how about the students with contrary condition? So, part time job its better solution for this situation. The student can help the parent to don't lost the cost too much. In the other hand, the students have new experience beside their daily activity(studying). The students must be smart to split their time. Because they add new activity for their time, studying and have a part time job. It's proudly can get their money by themselves than they must ask money from their parents as requirements in college. In my opinion, they are independent student. If all college students do that, I think the parents don't worry about financial problem. And for that student, it can be a start before they work at company after they graduate from that college. Maybe we can say its training to get a new skill for a job. So it's positive think for that student. In this era, nothing to say shine for do a something. If we can, why not? We can learn from college student who have a part time job.

The first is that part-time jobs are a valuable way to see how what students have learnt in class applies in the real world. Classroom education, especially at the university level, tends to be academic and theory-oriented. There is often little opportunity to see how these theories apply in practical usage. A part-time job in the same field as the student's degree will allow them to learn from professionals who apply these concepts on a daily basis. This will be a useful contrast from university classes, which are almost always taught by researchers. The second benefit of obtaining part-time employment alongside higher education is that it gives the student opportunities to pick up skills that they will need later when they enter the workforce, but are not taught in traditional university curricula. These include interpersonal skills and effective communication. University education is primarily designed to test whether the theoretical concepts taught have been learnt with sufficient clarity. When students enter the workforce, however, they often need to apply these concepts in concert with their colleagues. This will require them to communicate effectively and clearly. A part-time job will definitely give them an opportunity to exercise and improve this set of skills.""]"

Why? First, college students are old enough to be financially dependent. They are no more kids, and they have the responsibility to lessen the pressure from their parent. They have to understand how hard is working, thus, they can save and never waste their money. Second, they are no more students in a few years, so they have to judge what kind of job suit them through taking part-time jobs. Take me as an example. As a male, although I have to do the military responsibility first, and after one year then I have to work. I am very afraid now. Many of my classmates are worried about finding no job, and I may face the same situation after one year. One of my classmates declined a chance to be a teacher in the kindergarten, because she found herself having no interest in education. And some of my classmates felt sad and worried after the interview of a job, because they found themselves having no the skills or experiences that the boss wanted.

Second, you can learn how to deal with problems encountered in your work. When you solve these problems, you can get experiences. Those experiences will one day help you when you graduate from school. Last, you can make friends from your work. A good friend will be help of you future work, especially when you are in trouble.

The first is that part-time jobs are a valuable way to see how what students have learnt in class applies in the real world. Classroom education, especially at the university level, tends to be academic and theory-oriented. There is often little opportunity to see how these theories apply in practical usage. A part-time job in the same field as the student's degree will allow them to learn from professionals who apply these concepts on a daily basis. This will be a useful contrast from university classes, which are almost always taught by researchers. The second benefit of obtaining part-time employment alongside higher education is that it gives the student opportunities to pick up skills that they will need later when they enter the workforce, but are not taught in traditional university curricula. These include interpersonal skills and effective communication. University education is primarily designed to test whether the theoretical concepts taught have been learnt with sufficient clarity. When students enter the workforce, however, they often need to apply these concepts in concert with their colleagues. This will require them to communicate effectively and clearly. A part-time job will definitely give them an opportunity to exercise and improve this set of skills.""]"

Firstly, having part-time jobs to support college students' life in college can reduce their parents' financial burden. Our parents are no longer giving money to us or give less money to us.

The first is that part-time jobs are a valuable way to see how what students have learnt in class applies in the real world. Classroom education, especially at the university level, tends to be academic and theory-oriented. There is often little opportunity to see how these theories apply in practical usage. A part-time job in the same field as the student's degree will allow them to learn from professionals who apply these concepts on a daily basis. This will be a useful contrast from university classes, which are almost always taught by researchers. The second benefit of obtaining part-time employment alongside higher education is that it gives the student opportunities to pick up skills that they will need later when they enter the workforce, but are not taught in traditional university curricula. These include interpersonal skills and effective communication. University education is primarily designed to test whether the theoretical concepts taught have been learnt with sufficient clarity. When students enter the workforce, however, they often need to apply these concepts in concert with their colleagues. This will require them to communicate effectively and clearly. A part-time job will definitely give them an opportunity to exercise and improve this set of skills.""]"

Many times it's hard for us to say who is right or who is wrong. But in social opinion, also in my opinion, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. Firstly, having part-time jobs to support college students' life in college can reduce their parents' financial burden. Our parents are no longer giving money to us or give less money to us. It can save the whole family's expenses. Secondly, having part-time jobs can develop our ability. If we have a part-time job, we will know the society or interpersonal relationship better, and we may make friends with more people. It's useful for our future work. In other words we can prepare for our future. In a word, working opens our eyes. Finally, using the money that earned by ourselves, will make us feel great. We all know that food made by ourselves tastes more delicious, the house built by ourselves live more comfortable. As the same way, the money earned by ourselves spends more fulfilling. No matter you live in a poor family or rich family or well-off family, having part-time jobs can help you in many ways. So it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.""]"

In the other hand, the students have new experience beside their daily activity(studying). The students must be smart to split their time. Because they add new activity for their time, studying and have a part time job. It's proudly can get their money by themselves than they must ask money from their parents as requirements in college. In my opinion, they are independent student. If all college students do that, I think the parents don't worry about financial problem. And for that student, it can be a start before they work at company after they graduate from that college. Maybe we can say its training to get a new skill for a job. So it's positive think for that student. In this era, nothing to say shine for do a something. If we can, why not? We can learn from college student who have a part time job.

Second, they are no more students in a few years, so they have to judge what kind of job suit them through taking part-time jobs. Take me as an example.

There are many ways to find something to do and the best one is part time job. It is good for students to do the part time job because it will make the students get more experiences, students will earn money, and they may have the opportunities to get the job in future. Firstly, it is good for students to do the part time jobs because students will get more experiences. When students have to do the jobs, they will face many situations from consumers and the boss of them. They will have more patients and learn more to live with others in societies. Secondly, students will earn more money while they are learning. Part time job makes money for students too. Student will know the value of money and how hard they find them. From this, they will know how to use money and they will have money if they have to use it. Finally, another reason why it is good for students to have a part time job is they might get more opportunities for their works in future. If students work, they will meet many people. In addition, if the agency finds that this student is good at working, they can remember your name and reserve this student for doing the job when this student graduates. All in all, the students might strongly believe that to do the part time job is necessary and important. Because part time job can give more experiences, make money, and provide more opportunities for student in the future.']"

For me, I am also one of them. I fully agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, gaining a part-time job is not only for the purpose of earning much money. What values more is the experience you get to promote your capacity such as communication, independence, your solution to an issue, and so on. That is to say, you can do things on your own if you gain some experience from part-time job. Secondly, it is a good opportunity to be involved in the society, forming a foundation for your future work. We are students but we are adults now. Therefore, the campus is not the only place we should stay. Outside school, you will see more interesting things. However, what I want to say is that a job will certainly take much of your spare time that your may feel stressed. So you should learn to schedule your time before working. In that way, I believe you can balance your time and lead a colorful college life.']"

First, you can earn money in your own. When we grow up, the entire bill about studying was paid by our parents. Usually one enters the college at the age of eighteen. Eighteen years old means you are an adult. You should share the economical load of your family. You can use the money to pay for your registration and learn to be independent. Second, you can learn how to deal with problems encountered in your work. When you solve these problems, you can get experiences. Those experiences will one day help you when you graduate from school. Last, you can make friends from your work. A good friend will be help of you future work, especially when you are in trouble. He can save you when you need help. But as a student, your primary goal is get good grade to pass the exam. So don't spend too much time at part-time job. You need time to study and go to class. Try to distribute your time among class, part-time job, playing and rest! Those things must be balanced. Or you will be regret in the future.""]"

Teenagers who work part time job can practice to be careful when they meet many kind people and they will know benefit of money, how hard to earn it. I agree with a part time job. The first reason is part time job can help teenagers preparing life to adult that must have more responsibility. When teenagers take a part time job must have responsibility to manage time for study, relax, work, and travel. Second the young can learn how to life with other people, ad just the unfamiliar environment. Third teenagers learn what that she or he want to be in the future. They can plan what they have to learn that useful for their future job.

The first is that part-time jobs are a valuable way to see how what students have learnt in class applies in the real world. Classroom education, especially at the university level, tends to be academic and theory-oriented. There is often little opportunity to see how these theories apply in practical usage. A part-time job in the same field as the student's degree will allow them to learn from professionals who apply these concepts on a daily basis. This will be a useful contrast from university classes, which are almost always taught by researchers. The second benefit of obtaining part-time employment alongside higher education is that it gives the student opportunities to pick up skills that they will need later when they enter the workforce, but are not taught in traditional university curricula. These include interpersonal skills and effective communication. University education is primarily designed to test whether the theoretical concepts taught have been learnt with sufficient clarity. When students enter the workforce, however, they often need to apply these concepts in concert with their colleagues. This will require them to communicate effectively and clearly. A part-time job will definitely give them an opportunity to exercise and improve this set of skills.""]"

Many times it's hard for us to say who is right or who is wrong. But in social opinion, also in my opinion, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. Firstly, having part-time jobs to support college students' life in college can reduce their parents' financial burden. Our parents are no longer giving money to us or give less money to us. It can save the whole family's expenses. Secondly, having part-time jobs can develop our ability. If we have a part-time job, we will know the society or interpersonal relationship better, and we may make friends with more people. It's useful for our future work. In other words we can prepare for our future. In a word, working opens our eyes. Finally, using the money that earned by ourselves, will make us feel great. We all know that food made by ourselves tastes more delicious, the house built by ourselves live more comfortable. As the same way, the money earned by ourselves spends more fulfilling. No matter you live in a poor family or rich family or well-off family, having part-time jobs can help you in many ways. So it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.""]"
