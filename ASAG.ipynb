      "[\"In my opinion, it is necessary for college students to have part-time job once their school grade or other condition become steady. Why? First, college students are old enough to be financially dependent. They are no more kids, and they have the responsibility to lessen the pressure from their parent. They have to understand how hard is working, thus, they can save and never waste their money. Second, they are no more students in a few years, so they have to judge what kind of job suit them through taking part-time jobs. Take me as an example. As a male, although I have to do the military responsibility first, and after one year then I have to work. I am very afraid now. Many of my classmates are worried about finding no job, and I may face the same situation after one year. One of my classmates declined a chance to be a teacher in the kindergarten, because she found herself having no interest in education. And some of my classmates felt sad and worried after the interview of a job, because they found themselves having no the skills or experiences that the boss wanted. So I think it's good to test college students' ability by having part-time job.\", \"Actually, student doesn't have a lot of time to waste. Before senior high, you must have to learn the basic theory. So you just have only 7 years to learn the pro level knowledge, and choice your job which you maybe will do your whole life. If you don't study hard, you may lose the job you want. Everyone wants to do the job they want, so you can't avoid to compare with others, many company decide who they want is determined by who have more pro level knowledge. Maybe there also have several company will decide it by your part-time experience. But the most of part-time job doesn't relative the job you find. Because the company doesn't let untrained person to do the complex job. So you also couldn't get any plus from your part-time experience when you find the job. Part-time job is not bad choice when you are a student, but you should control your time well. Don't let part-time job take huge part in your life. You still have to take time to concentrate on your study. Study still should be the first in your ranking. Time is money, if you control your time well, you will have a lot of good experience to enrich your life. Knowledge is the most important power for student. It's an unchangeable rule.\", \"Nowadays, quite a number of college students are taking part-time jobs. But is it necessary for them to do so? In my opinion, the answer can be various, depending on the students themselves. Undoubtedly, taking a part-time job is a special experience which provides youths with the chance to get close to society as well as to gain more practical skills. In the process, the students learn how to communicate with different kinds of people and how to deal with challenging situations. Besides, the money they get from the job will certainly reduce the burden of their parents more or less. However, it can't be ignored that some students fail more important things in order to take part-time jobs. They spend time which should be for learning to work, thus leading to decline of grades. But the fact is that the first thing for students is still study. Also, some young people fail to spend their money reasonably. Instead, they fall into the habit of wasting money. So, it can be concluded that taking a part-time job is rewarding and eye-opening for those who have good self-regulation but it may have some side effects if the student doesn't have a good plan. In common with many things, part-time job is a double-edged sword. If you want to take it, do be careful.\", \"I think get a part job while study, is depend on the person. If she/ he wants to gain money or get more experience I think it should be okay. But, when we are really busy, no time and easily tired. It is not better choice. Get part job has a negative and positive opinions. In positive : you can get more money for helping your parent, increase your income, get more experience, get more friends and more independent for take care your self so you can be mature. And the negative area is : you easily for tired, spending many time for work, and less time of study. If you want to get good mark, I think we should think twice about take a part job like this? Can we manage our time, and can we maintain all of this, although we should think twice about our body health.. because take a part job is pretty difficult when you can't manage it in the right side. If I must choose one of this.. I will not. Because It is pretty difficult from me to manage my time, and actually I am easily tired. Despite, I didn't have any goals in my major (accounting ) like getting a good Final Exam mark or etc, I just doing all of this as usual. Take a part job like this just spend my time and myself into risks. So I absolutely refuse about this.\", \"I agree because, first part time job make you spend your free time in the right way. Somebody kill their time by go shopping or traveling all of activity lose your time but if you get the job in the shop or restaurant. That's earning your money. Second it can improve your skill if you only meet the small social and have no accommodate so the job would help you to meet new many kinds of people that's might be good for you. Third it's improved your patient and can make you grow up; the job sometime might be hard or not comfortable; if you can pass it that would be great. Fourth you are in the college that's mean you are not the little child. The part time job can help you parent and you would be proud to your self that you can earn your pocket money by your two hands but in other word your mother would not reprove you any more about your new shirt or new shoes. And the last reason some learner have not much time to have an exercise so do the job would help you to move your body and use your brain the result is your health is good. I think it is the good way to spend your time on past time job and don't forget to study hard too.\", 'I agree with the question. I have four reasons. First of all, I think it is important for university students to experience before getting a job. For example, if students who are finished university get a job and have to hardly work, they can not accuratly work. that is because they have not enough experiences. In the university, no one teaches excutive abilities. Second, lots of korean students do not know valuableness about money since lots of korean university students get a pocket money from parents. i think people who have never experienced about part-time job do not know notableness about money. Third, to know about spending money. I think a lot of student do not have experience to work as a part-time job and they do not know how to management spending money. Because they have never experienced working and earning the money themselves. so it is good at experience for university student to work as a part time job. Last thing is that they can know lots of people. If students who work part time job, they can be know a lot of workers than general university student. In Korean, it is important to know the people who is in the same part. consequentially, I agree with working part-time job for university students.', \"I disagree with that opinion. I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two main reasons. The first reason is that students should study. What students have to do is study, but some students can't study enough because of their part-time job. For example, my friend has a part-time job to teach English for elementary school students. She looks so busy everyday to prepare for teaching. She often checks their answers in examination even during a class in the university. Also, she is likely to be late for a class because she has to prepare for teaching all night. I can't think it is good for her. In that case, part-time job prevents from her study. The second reason is that many students spend most salary playing, not living. They mainly spend their money clothes, their hobby, dating, traveling and so on. This means most of them don't work for living. For instance, my friend who I stated above is one of such students. She lives with her family and doesn't have to work. However, she wants to get more clothes and to follow fashion. In closing, I don't want to say students must not do part-time job, but it is not so important for them. Therefore, I think it is unimportant for college students to have a part-time job.\", \"It's not important at all in my view. Students have far too much to worry about just trying to pass their exams let alone also trying to hold down a job while they study. Some folks may disagree I know, but the fact still remains that in today's society, students are being taught to perform at high levels from primary school to university and/or college and quite frankly, it is a big ask. This is particularly true when students are studying for more comprehensive careers such as in medicine etc where study loads are quite heavy and competition is high. Being a student myself, I can't imagine trying to get within the top ten percent of my course and hold down a job as well, even if it is only for a few hours a week. It takes me all my time just to complete my study schedule on any given day without having to trundle off to a job at the local fast food shop. I know that several of my fellow students are in the same boat and feel the same way that I do. We have a tremendous amount of reading to do, just to try to keep up with our workload. For me to pass with high scores, I know that I couldn't possibly take on a job and still perform at a high level. On that basis, I don't believe that it is important for students to have a part-time job because I believe, for me anyway, that it is more important to focus on studies and let the jobs come later.\", \"It is true statement. Part time job is the job that usually choosed and done by the college student. For example as private teacher, shopkeeper, seller, etc. They follow this job on the part time on their day which they don't doing everything after they had studied in the university. It has many benefit for them. A part time job can give many useful, experience, knowledge, proudly, and the important is money. College student as the young man who needs some money to go on their lifes without ask from their parents. They must begin to independence to follow their necessity by self. As know, they have many necessity to pay their study, to buy something that need in their day, or eat, and other thing. They can show to their family that they can do and become active people for training theirself to fill on the society in the future and useful for around. Therefore, with that, it can expression their skill that they get from their studies in university or other skill they have over there. It can make creative and contribute for our government. Finally, it's very benefit things for the college student to have a part time job to make they be active and get some money to fill their life.\", 'I agree. I have many friends who are having a part-time job. They often work around a university. In particular, they go to there after finishing the lesson. I do not have experience which works a part-time job. Nevertheless, I believe that college students need to work specially during school vacation. Because, First, A part-time job offers students importance of money. They will get money through hard suffer. Therefore, they will use little money and save money. College students usually spend drinking and enjoying friends so, they use money easily. It can intend to save money from the wastefulness. Second, students are receiving a lot of money from their parent. Especially, registration fee is very expensive but many students obtain their parent. If they get money to use their personal expense, parents will think a hard feel. Accordingly, students need to make the money to use on their own. Last, students get a priceless experience through a part-time job. After graduate from college, they will work at company and occur many things at their company. If they have a part-time job, they obtain a new opportunity before a true job. They can learn about their key contents and factors in advance. It is main thing for college students to have a part-time job.', \"Recently, there has been a discussion about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two opinions about this question. Some people think it is good to have part-time job. But some other people don't think it is good to do it. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reasons. Some people are agree with this sentence. Firstly, if they have a part-time job, they can relieve their parents' burden. Besides, it also can increase their chances to practice in society. However, some people object this opinion. They claim that part-time jobs will waste student's time and affect their studying. Therefore, they just need to work hard. As far as I am concerned that students should have a part-time job on the basis of working selectively. For one thing, by working they can keep themselves well informed of as much knowledge as possible. For another, without selection, some working that everyone can do will waste our times. And we will learn less. Also it will make working ineffective because of we don't do the job which we should do. All in all, it is necessary that we should have a part-time job and have some selection.\", \"It is important for college students to have a part time job because it has many advantages for the students. It will make the students become an independent people. The students will get income to pay their living cost from salary of their job. They will not bother their parents and spend their parents' money so much. Moreover, the students will be discipline because they can manage the time well, they know the time when they have to study and when they have to work. In the part time job, the workers may not be late to come to their job. So, it forces the students as the workers to be on time in their job. Not only that, it also can develope the student's knowlegde skill. The students can develope their knowlegde when they are having a part time job. So, after getting lesson from the college, the students directly can apply it in their job. Furthermore, the studebts can use their time well, they can avoid from wasting the time, such as playing, shopping, and many others. And their time just for useful activity. So, having a part time job for the college students is very useful and important. And all the students in the college should provide their time for having a part time job.\", \"I think it is good but necessary for college students to have a part-time job. It is good to have some working experiments in school. More working experiments might help you have more chance than the other to get the job you want after you leaving school. This means, it may bring you more competitive capacity than others. And you can also learn how to get along with people, and understand the difficulty of earning money. It may make you more mature. But in the other way, as we may spend almost whole the rest of our life to seek and work hard for money, I don't think it is necessary for us to start it in our school life. People always want to be adults in their childhood; and want to be students when they started working. There are many things we can do only in school. Unless there are economy problems, I don't think the time the part-time job cost is worthy. Moreover, for those who cannot arrange their time well, it is possible to spend too much time and energy on the part-time job, which cause they overpass their school grades. Thus, if there are no reasons, enjoy your college life. Don't be too eager to step in your business life, or you may regret with it.\", \"Part time job is very important for college students. The statement was made based on my own reason. First, have a part time job will be useful for us one day in the future. We could learn how to earn our own money, how to manage our income, and many other things so the time we have will not be wasted. Moreover, if we are from another island, our part time job could reduce our family's financial problem even if it's just a little. Second, we must admit, sometimes, the money that is transferred monthly by our parents is not enough for our daily need. Earning money by ourselves will be a very helpful thing so we won't burden our parents by asking more money. They also can't complain about how we are going to use it because it's the money that we earn, so we have the right to manage it by ourselves. Last but not least, part time job helps us to be independent. It gives us experience to handle the problems we will face in our full time job in the future. It also helps us to learn how to socialize with our co-workers, how to be close with them, or how to handle the problems those occurred by them. It's also easier to find a job if we have the experience to work for the other people. For example, if we ever had a job and want to find a new job, our chance to be accepted is higher than the ones who never have a job at all. So I conclude that having a part time job is very important for college students.\", \"All of students at university must use a lot of money because life at university has different from high school. It has many new things to pay such as we must pay a lot of books for use in learning. Then we should have a part-time job because students like us must pay a lot of money not only buy books but also we use money for buy cloths, for travel with friends and for use at the entertain things. If all of students have part-time job is very interested because we can have money by myself and part-time job can help us for manage time don't waste time at dormitory in play game online or chat online and sleep in the bed. If we have part-time job at university I think it can help us for future career because we can manage time and service. Part-time job is very important for all of students but it can damage us if we cannot manage time for study and job. Then if we want to have part0time job we should make sure that we can manage time for study and for job don't fail of both. I don't disagree to have a part-time job but students should know what is benefit or necessary for them to do.\", 'In college, students want to find something to do to have the new experience and money. There are many ways to find something to do and the best one is part time job. It is good for students to do the part time job because it will make the students get more experiences, students will earn money, and they may have the opportunities to get the job in future. Firstly, it is good for students to do the part time jobs because students will get more experiences. When students have to do the jobs, they will face many situations from consumers and the boss of them. They will have more patients and learn more to live with others in societies. Secondly, students will earn more money while they are learning. Part time job makes money for students too. Student will know the value of money and how hard they find them. From this, they will know how to use money and they will have money if they have to use it. Finally, another reason why it is good for students to have a part time job is they might get more opportunities for their works in future. If students work, they will meet many people. In addition, if the agency finds that this student is good at working, they can remember your name and reserve this student for doing the job when this student graduates. All in all, the students might strongly believe that to do the part time job is necessary and important. Because part time job can give more experiences, make money, and provide more opportunities for student in the future.', 'While a great many of my friends and family think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job or seek some form of supplementary income, I simply do not think it is that important for college students to have a job. First, in many large ways students already have a job. Their job is to be students. Their job is to learn to go to school. They should not be required to work as a kid easily lead a distraction from their studies and have a negative impact on their performance in classes. In college, we always say that you can only pick two of the three areas which are good grades, sleep, and a social life. The fact of the matter is that we are already busy enough learning and making new connections to have extra time to work. That being said, there are opportunities such as work study which allow you to make a little bit of cash and sometimes allow you to study on the job. I think this is much different from part time work, in which you must focus your attention solely on the task at hand and have no room to keep up with schoolwork.', 'I agree with it. I have three reasons to support my answer. Firstly, I think we should have a part-time job to learn how work before employed in a company. We go to a university to learn many things before employed and we have much time to do something after classes. We can choose whether we have a part-time job to learn how work or not. So we should have it. Secondly, I suppose we should know how hard earning is. I had not known that earning money to live is really hard since I have had part-time job. And I could thank my parents. I think it is important for us to know how hard earning and thank parents. Thirdly, we can use payments of part-time job to do many things for experiences. As I said we have much time in a university. And we can do something for ourselves by using payments of part-time job. For example, we can go travel and see the world, buy books, organize a student conference and so on. I think that experiences will help us after graduate. So I agree that is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because we can learn how work, we can know how hard earning is and we can get good experiences thanks to part-time job.', \"I agree with the statement. I think there are two points for the reason I agree. First, to have a part-time job when we are college students can be a preparation for being a member of society. I have had a part-time job for four years. My part-time job is teaching junior high school students Math and English. I learned many important things. For example, how to talk with boss, how to deal with personal information, how to associate with my colleague. If I didn't have it, I would not have any common knowledge, sense and friend. I think I grew as a adult person compared with I was high school student. Second, it is a chance we know the importance and value of money. When I received salary which was made by myself for the first time, I thought that I mustn't waste money. Until I entered college, I used to be bought many things by my parents. It is not too much to say that I didn't know how hard we make money. Recently, many college students had a part-time job. I think they also learn many things like me. So, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.\", \"I agree with this statement. In my opinion, there are two big reasons. Firstly, we can get money. College students need a lot of money for many things. For me, it's really important to go out with friends and go shopping, go to stylish café, and drink. I can't survive without money from my part time job. Some people get money from their parents, but I don't want to bother my parents. They already pay for my school and lent, it costs a lot. I think I have to earn money for my amusement fee by myself. And another reason is that we can get valuable experiences. We meet new people and learn about service for customer, how difficult or hard to get money before we graduate school. I could thank to my parents as I knew what to make money and how hard. Also I learned about the service manner. It would be useful when I get a job. Of course studying is the most important things for students, but we won't be able to get this kind of experience in university. I think experiences from part time job is as value as class in school. That's why I agree with having a part time job.\", \"I don't agree that it's important for college students to have a part time job, besides they must. Taiwan's education is not similar to U. S; we don't have many vary choice to choose which one we like or want to touch in school. Only in college, we choose many way to learn, even you are not major the department, you also can choose the class of other departments. In college, you can touch many vary things, and you can control what time you want to go to school except major classes. How many classes you have touched? Except major classes, you have much time to do you want to do, you might want to rest instead of in class all day, you can use the time to swim or do some sports. How long will you stay in college? General students are 4 years in Taiwan, you spend one third times of 4 years to major classes, and more than one third to other classes, the rest of time is not much to you to do anything you want to realize deeply. Sometimes, you thought money is most important to your life, but, to my opinion, learning is really the most important.\", \"If you resolve to have a part-time job, what are the purposes? Is it for the money, or is it for the experiences and the learning-in-the-process that lures your to take one?As we know, most of us have to step into the society after graduation, and the society which will confront us is quite different from the campus life we are used to lining in. So, if money is your solitary goal and your cannot be distracted by the expand of your circle, the acquisition of the communication skills. I suggest you'd better concentrate on your study and do not bother to think of a part time job. For the simple reason, that high marks can get you a better job. But if you come to a part-time job for more, you can face advantage of all that it has to offer. In the change of an excellent university student to a new employee, you may get scorn and criticism often. which will have your reflect on yourself and define who you are. Taking a part-time job will give you a glimpse of the real world and make you well-prepared for the future. By observing the society first hand, you learn a lot outside the book. So you can see my opinions quite clear now. Put away the money you can get let yourself develop quickly in your part time job experience!\", 'I completely agree this statement. I have totally four reason that agree this statement First Variety part time job is serve our experience For- example if I were work in convenience store, I can learn ability king, good smile and good greet or If I were work in A factory, I learn patient, understand that how appliances are made by the Factory. Etc. we can receive many variety experience by doing diverse part-time job. Second if I were variety work part time job, I can find fitting job or major. For example I work at institute for my money, but fortunately I can find my job by working institute that teach for student. Then I can decide my dream. Also I can endeavor for my dream and I don\\'t need to wander not any more. Third I can know valuable and concept of money. If I were hardly earning the money, the money is very priceless. Therefore I can\\'t expense the money. I try to save the money and know my parent\\'s difficult earning the money Finally Steve job\\'s said \"Connect the dots\". So I challenge variety part time job\\'s that surely someday help to me Consequently I assert that Part time job is need for college student.', \"In my opinion, I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job. Why? I have two reasons. First, a part-time job can increase our experience, and you could learn many things that don't teach in the class. For example, if you work in a restaurant, you could learn how to communicate with different people, and you also could learn how to handle emergency condition. If you are a home-teacher, you could increase your patience and you will know it's not easy to be a good teacher, maybe you will study more hard in the class. Also, you can make different kinds of people in different job, than you could learn more from their experience. Second, a part-time job can earn money, than you can share the economic press with your parents. Maybe the money is not much, but the feeling of earning money by yourself is so good. Finally, I suggest college students should find a part-time job. Maybe the job you do has no relation with what you study now, but it's a good way to try different things. It will make your college life more colorful. And it really has a lot beneficial in your future career life.\", \"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. As everyone knows, lots of college students have a part-time job. I'm no exception. I also even got many part-time jobs at the same time, such as tutor who teaches sociology, cram school teacher, sales and so on. So I really agree has a part-time job in college life. There are some reasons to explain why we have a part-time job. First, now lots of goods are more expensive than before and families give children less pocket money. College students have to look for a part-time job to expense many things. In addition, I think that we can know many people who have their own characteristic in society, even be our friends. Finally, enhancing the social experience, practicing working attitude, gaining more jobs in the future and l can avoid to working nothing. And this is the main reason that college students to have a part-time job. In sum, having a part-time job let me understand that giving up halfway can't undertake any hard task nowadays. Besides, a boss didn't want that someone has no skill like coach potato in the company. Without a doubt, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.\", 'If we do part—time job, of course we will have a good experience and we will get income by ourselves. Part time job is a good thing to do in free time especially in college students group because they have more free time and freedom to do anything that they want. In my opinion, part time job is a good thing to do and I think it is important for college students because they have many free time to do that and it will be a good experience for them. Though there are a lot of activities to do at their universities and each activity will give them the good experience put it is not enough if they have problem about money, they want to get more income so part time job is very important for people in this group. Another reason that support my opinion part time job is important for college students. There are we can help our parents to decrease the pay if we have income from part time job. However, part time job maybe not important for someone who very rich but it is a good chance to do for make a new experience and if you do it and when you get income by yourself that make you are so proud with yourself.', \"I think part time job is very important. Because we are going to learn experience in part time job and we earn much money. But many students think part time job more important than study. Nevertheless, I think that many people are going to have a part time job. Part time job experience is to be. Because meets many people and learn experience. Here is a lot of reason that students have part time job. First, the part time job experience is going to learn sociability that meets many people. Because many part time job meet people in these days. So sociability is very important. Many customers like to have high social skill worker. Therefore many employers choose to have social skill employee. Second, the part time job is going to earn much money. Many students received pocket money by parent. So there haven't part time job experience and earn money of them. When receive earn money, they are going to be pleased. Finally, they get experience of many part time jobs. These days Korea has many kind of job. So students are going to get experience. When find a job, part time job experience is very important. In conclusion, many students will have part time job. And student study more. So they survive in a competitive society.\", \"I agree that college students have a part time job. Because if college students have part time job, they improve sociality College students experience social life early They improve sociality than students don't have a part time job As a result, the students will get a job, they can adapt more easily Also, college students earn money themselves without their parents help Therefore they will know that money earning is very hard So, they think that money is precious. They easily don't spend money And money worry can reduce to parents. As college students earn money themselves Finally the reason I agree that college students have a part time job is making friends While they work part time job, they meet many people So they can make many friends and they meet various many people, they improve speaking skills Because of speaking skills very important to their life, improving speaking skills is helpful themselves College students have a part time job is many benefits for college students Therefore college students can better to experience part time job Their major related part time job is more effective If college students don't disturb study, they can have a part time job is very good\", \"I agree that college students have a part-time job. There are five reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, by doing part-time job, they can find earning money very hard. So, they use their money seriously. And the college students have much time. So if they want travel abroad, they can make money by doing part-time job for their own. Planning how to use money is helpful when they begin to work. Secondly, if they do a part-time job, they can meet people of variety generation, from children to senior adults. So they can know various people's way of thinking. Thirdly, the harder they do a part-time job, the more evaluated they are. For example, their salary per hour is maybe up. Fourthly, by doing many kinds of part-time job, they can know their suitable future job such as teaching children, or serve customs in shops, and so on. In fact, I have a lot of friends who want to become teachers. And they teach junior high school students studying. Lastly, they have responsibility for their job. It is an important thing when they work. As above, they can know society's basic rules. This is why I agree that college students have a part-time job.\", \"Whether college students should take part-time jobs has aroused great public concern. As far as I'm concerned, part-time job plays an increasing important role in college life and I'm for the idea. Nevertheless, several people argue that it is a waste of time to take a part-time job and obviously, college students ought to put more emphasis on their study. In addition, part-time job not only takes up much of their free time but also means little to them. On the contrary, others think that it is acceptable, reasonable, and beneficial to take a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. First of all, it is undeniable that college students can accumulate certain experience through part-time jobs. Then, as a result of doing part-time jobs, we can earn some pocket money in order to reduce parents' burden. What's more, admittedly, if you do some more work at your free time, you will find life is not so dull and you can do something meaningful to enjoy your college life. In a word, from my perspective, part-time job, to some extent, is indispensable to our college life. Regardless of other people's ideas, I support my own opinion and I think it is essential for college students to take part-time job.\", 'I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job; first, college students should be responsible for their behaviors, not to rely on parents all the time, even on daily life spending. They can earn a living by taking part-time job, so that they will know earning money was not as easy as they thought. Once they have taken a part-time job, they will be more careful when spending money and be more responsible for their behaviors. Second, by taking a part-time job, they can make friends with who have the same interest with him. For example, if you take a job to be a seller, you will meet someone who is outgoing and also loves to interact with people; if you work in the kitchen of whatever restaurant, you will meet someone who also interested in cooking or baking. So no matter what kind of job they take, they can always find someone who shares the same interest with him. Last but not the least; through the job, students can learn something which cannot learn in school. Such as, how to interact with costumers and what to do when being complain, how to work perfectly with co-workers and also the boss, also, they will know which ability they lacking of, so they can learning even harder during free time or school. With those three reasons, I totally agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.', 'A part-time job for college student ? Hmm.... of course this statement not strange again in your ears, if you talk about a part – time job; we will find most of agreement and disagreement. How about you ? is this important to you ? Firstly, well. Everybody have difference opinions. Perhaps, I think a part – time job for college students so very important at this moment because the workers students could pocket money by self to buy all instrument of living self. In this moment, college students could buy a book, food, drink, enjoy with special friend, and more. Secondly, I feel a part – time job help parent. If other students family could not enough needed to college student( child ) so, who is again will be completing need for college students ?, of course self college students. At this moment, college students to value a great struggle in living self. Thirdly, in my opinion, a part – time job for college students because college students to have a full free time, then college students to take function about tme use a good deal happened everything ok. Fourthly, i feel a part – time job as experience to college students because the experience is the best teacher as added knowledge for college students. For the reason above, only some opinion about it is important for college students to have a part – time job in living college students. Actually, no wrong of agreement about a part – time job, we must realize that apart – time job for college students.', 'In my opinion. I think the students will work part time to earn extra after school is not very important. If students do not have a financial problems. They should be study hard. When they have free time, they should read books or do other activity such as sport, music etc. But if a part-time job does not interfere with the time to read books or do other activity and students need to lighten the burden of home. It is better to work part-time job. We should see that their own ability. We have enough ability to learn, coupled with a part-time job without any study or not. Because at least. A part-time job is a practical experience of working with others as well. In case of students have a financial problems in the family. A part-time job is quite important because it will lighten the burden of home and earn income families to rely on themselves. So that parents do not have to worry about our expenditures. Moreover, there is also a self-trained to work experience, responsible for your work, trained themselves on time and working with others as well too. Therefore, a part-time job is important or not. It depends on several factors as well.', \"Society has more and more challenges for college students. So it is important for us to have much experience. In our country there are plenty of college students undertaking a part-time job or even more than one part-time job. It's quite common to see students to be busy after classes. But why is it important for us to get these? First, I think part-time jobs are a good way to count our thumbs. College isn't as busy as high school. When we finish our study, so much time is waste for playing computer games or doing other boring things. If a part-time job belongs to us, we will try our best to do it. After all, that's a way to show the ability we have. Second, part-time jobs can help us knowing more people. Colleges just have students and teachers. But society has quite different people. They do all kinds of work, and experience interesting things you have never heard. Through your part-time job you could get good interpersonal relationship. After you graduated, you will go to society. When you need help, these people can give it to you. Finally, it is the most important one. The key point is you can get the experience the book can't teach you. Practice is the way which could check the truth. If you only can talk about how to do it, no one will believe you. You have to study what should you do. And part-time jobs would let you knowing those. So college students' having a part-time job is necessary and important.\", 'I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. The reason is that they can learn a lot of things which are very important but which are not taught in schools. For example, they can learn how to build a good relationship between colleagues or a boss. Whatever part time they you may be doing, it is usual that you need to cooperate with others to work. Through these kinds of cooperation, they can learn what is important to make relations with colleagues or bosses better. In my case, I am English for high school students in a cram school as a part time job. Through the experience of cooperating with other teachers and teaching for students, I realized how important it is to mutually communicate with people. Another example is that they can grow a respectable recognition towards money. Through working hard and then getting money as a salary, they realize that getting money require hard work and how important money is. This also applies to me. Before I started to work as a part time, I thought that money is something that is given by my parents for free but now I think that money need labor and time. In conclusion, a part time job can teach many important things to students. Therefore, college students should have a part time job.', \"I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. While it is true that college tuition fees are high these days, there have also been scholarships and loans being offered too. I believe that this has to take into account the idea of'opportunity cost'. Take for example the case of a student who is deciding whether or not to work to support his studies or to spend more time studying to obtain a better result. The student has the option of working harder and spending more time to study to obtain scholarship for his studies. The scholarship could solve the student's financial problems in addition to getting excellent results. I believe that this is an issue of investment of time. Students who do part time job are generally tired when they attend classes. This could affect their studies indirectly. A person could choose to instead invest his or her time on studies instead while applying for a loan to support the tuition fees. Being able to pay the tuition fees by working part time and being tired or sleepy in classes is not a good option. By doing the comparison, spending more time on studies thus getting better results and obtaining a scholarship is a better one. In conclusion, the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job should be discarded as it is not a viable alternative of solving a person's financial constraint problems. It is not wise for a student to forgo his studies to support his or her school tuition fees.\", \"Part time job is one of the skills every college students needs before getting a job. It is like a training for every college student who is about to embark on their future careers. It is also a source of income for those independent students, for those who pay for their tuition or for those who want to have extra allowances. Having a part time job also has its pros and cons but it is still based on the person taking it. Maybe, for him it's difficult but for other people they enjoy every minute of it. People will never be what they seem; it will always surprise you on what they can really do in life. When you have a part time job, you earn extra money and extra money. When you have extra money no one will stop you in buying whatever you want. Whether it's a Christian Dior dress or a Louis Vuitton bag, no one's stopping you in buying those things since the money is yours and you have the right to spend it on anything you want. People may think you're a spender but when you earn something by yourself and buy the things you want, you feel ecstatic, excited, happy and proud for yourself. But getting a part time job depends on whether you are busy with school projects or not, of course, studies are our first priority when it comes to school. It teaches us how to prioritize our time management because we do part time jobs for additional allowances or for money but study will always comes first for every college students around the world with part time jobs.\", \"Nowadays, there are so many University students who not only go to their campus, listen their teacher's explanation, do their tasks, and study, but also taking a part time job. The University students do this to fill their spare time after they finished their study at their University. With taking a part time job they hope they can get salary to fulfill their University needs, for example, copies their paper, searching their homework with go to the Internet center, buy some books to support their reports, join study tour which is a programme from their University to make a thesis, etc. Besides, they get good enough salary from their taking a part time job, to honest, they want to have experiences, challenges, friends, net-working and the last they want to enjoy their young life before they really come into world job. University students who taking a part time job should be wise to set their time between their duty as a University student and their part time job. Actually, it is not easy, but when they take decision to taking a part time job, they already though hardly about the positive sides and the negative sides. They also should have the permission from their parents when they are taking a part time job. Like my friend, she work as private teacher. She works in her spare time. She is good in time management. She enjoys her works, because of that, she turn into an independent woman. It means that a part time job sometime can cause a good effect.\", \"I agree with it. Because they need a training to work before graduate. Studying in college is very different from working in society. If they don't study hard that is a personal problem. But if employees don't work hard that is not a personal problem. And if they have a part-time job they can get a lot to learn. For example responsibility, hospitability, communication skills, how to solve problems, and so on. And they will quickly get used to working when they have a full-time job as they have experiences to work. But working in college days is not the only thing to do. Of course they need to study and reading. If they don't study their college fee is no use. However a lot of students tend to take their time to work for money that they can use for what they want. They need a social training but they have to understand what is important to do now. They can work as much as they want after graduate. But college life is only one time for many students. So it is important for college students to have a part time job, and it is also important for them to study. Balance is a key to success their college days.\", 'As we know, college student are doing their task in a college what we call it study, almost from them come from outside city. Perhaps they are not coming from rich family they came from a poor family. Some of their parent has profession as a farmer, teacher, fisherman and etc. In fact, is not their obligation to look for money, but this is a kind of demand for their life. They need money for their life. So, there is a kind reason or we can say so much reason for this statement, some people has a part time job is an obligation and some people are not. Sometimes, we found college students has a part time job to complete their needed such as living cost and college administration. And we also found some college students do it for search an experience for their future and better live, and only for fill in their free time or just for having fun. So, in my opinion have a part time job for college students is important. Beside they can help their parent, they can also learn how to manage a time and of course their financial in their life now on.', 'When we come to the topic of part time job, we will normally related it to most of the teenagers especially university students nowadays. However, this phenomenon has been widely questioned by most of the people today whereby most of the people think that the task for a student to go for a university is to study and gain knowledge instead of working and earn money. Hence, do part time job really good for a student or it gives bad impact to the students? The answer can be pros and cons; it is only based on personal opinion. For me, going for a part time job consists of more pros rather than cons. For example, students who go for a part time not only can earn extra income but also get to learn how to balance their work and study. They begin to learn how to financing their money well and of course when they are exposed to working life; they will definitely learn extra knowledge that will never teach in the school. For example, the way in communicating with their colleagues is totally different with the way they communicate with their friends. In addition, they also learn how to be more independent and responsible. No matter how, most of the students go for part time job are mainly due to financial problems such as they may having difficulty in paying their tuition fee and so on. Thus, one of the fastest ways to solve their problem will be go for a part time job. However, most of them will normally facing the problem of not enough sleep, absence for their classes due to he or she has part time job reason and so on. As a result, their performance in school may be get influenced. In conclusion, part time job can be a controversial topic as it may be pros to someone who are willing to learn but cons to someone who are actually weak in managing themselves.', \"Nowadays, college education has attracted the attention of society. What should the college education be? What ought college students to learn? The most common argument is whether college students should take a part-time job. In my opinion, having a part-time job is vital for students. As we all know, students have a lot of free time to manage, so it is very convenient for students to take a part-time job. In the future, we must step into the society and face a variety of difficulties, having a job can help us gain the life experience, what's more, we can meet all walks of people and learn to know how to cope with complex relationships between us and colleagues. Else, we can make our own money and we may realize it is hard for parents to earn money. But it also has unfavorable aspect. The main task for students is study, having a job may possess most of the free time and may affect students' daily life. Taking a part-time job is not a bad thing as long as we do not overstate it but stick to reality and personality. I think if we can manage our time precisely to take a job, we will be sure to get lots of benefits and get more chances to be distinguished in the future.\", \"I agree this statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. I think the best way to learn the money and the society is to do a part-time job. In doing a part-time job, college students learn the money and the society and understand how difficult to earn money is. And college students learn the society which is not in the school. More and more college students are doing a part-time job, they are able to prepare the future life when they work for their families. If college students don't a part-time job and don't know what a life is, they have great difficulty in working. In college year, manager don't claim college students heavily if they make a mistake. But in company, manager claim them heavily. To get used to work and earn money, college students need to do a part-time job. College students need to do a part-time job to know what a life is. So I agree this statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job.\", \"Today an increasing number of college students take part-time jobs. Have you ever taken a part-time job?There are many advantages for us to take part-time jobs. Firstly, part-time jobs help us keep up with the outside world. They can gain working experience and become more independent. Besides, it's a good chance for us to put what we have learned at college into practice. Through part-time jobs, we can prepare ourselves for our future jobs. What's more, we can make money to pay for everything we want. On the other hand, it can release our family financial burden. However, there also are many disadvantages. If we take part-time jobs, it is likely for us to distract from our studying. We may spend too much time and energy. For example, we may lose time needed for sleep, rest, study, club activities and recreation. So that it is harmful to our health. In my opinion, as a college student we should take the right attitude to part-time jobs. Although, part-time jobs can open us a window to know about the society, we must keep a balance between the job and the study! However, I think I should pay more attention to school study.\", 'Nowadays, college students are allowed to take part time jobs while studying. The type jobs are varies from shop clerk to cleaning services. Personally I think that these part time jobs are important to college students. As we can see, not everyone in this world is rich. The same applied to college students. Some of them can not their education fees and may need to have additional income source. One of those sources is by doing part time jobs. Part time jobs allow the college students to earn money without neglecting their studies. It is an effective solution for students with monetary problems Besides money, part time jobs also give work experience. When we are entering the world, experiences are a good asset for us. Those assets can be gained by doing part time jobs. For example: waiter. In some restaurant, we can see many part timer works as waiter. Those waiters can get communication experiences while they serve the customer. Part time jobs also can increase some essential skills. One of them is time management. Part timer must manage their time so their work schedules are not crashes with their college schedule. Also they must know when to take a break for learning and doing projects. This way they can learn how to manage their time effectively. Part time jobs can be helpful for college students. It can give additional income, experiences and building our skills. So I think it is important to have part time jobs.', \"Although some people think that university students should concentrate on their study and they should not take part-time job; however, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many advantages for university students taking part-time job. First, if they take part-time job which is related to their major, they will understand more about their major and future job. For many high school students in Taiwan, they just choose their major by their grades or they just choose it according to their parents. Some people find that they dislike their job after they started to work in the field. However, they already spent years completing their bachelor degree and it may be too late for them to study another major in the university. One of my friend's major is accounting. After she had internship in Ernst and Young, she realized that she does not want to work in the Big Four in the rest of her life. Another advantage of taking part-time job is earning money and local economics. There are many old opportunities for university students to be a home teacher. Students can earn money while children in Taiwan can have better education. According to some surveys, teenagers are more likely to spend money than people. As a result, if university students cannot take part-time job, there will be a negative impact on local economics. In conclusion, university students have the right to have part-time jobs. Since there are so many advantages for students taking part-time job, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.\", 'Nowadays, more and more college students think it is of great value and necessity to get a part-time job. For me, I am also one of them. I fully agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, gaining a part-time job is not only for the purpose of earning much money. What values more is the experience you get to promote your capacity such as communication, independence, your solution to an issue, and so on. That is to say, you can do things on your own if you gain some experience from part-time job. Secondly, it is a good opportunity to be involved in the society, forming a foundation for your future work. We are students but we are adults now. Therefore, the campus is not the only place we should stay. Outside school, you will see more interesting things. However, what I want to say is that a job will certainly take much of your spare time that your may feel stressed. So you should learn to schedule your time before working. In that way, I believe you can balance your time and lead a colorful college life.', 'Today, people live in a fast-paced society. People need to survive and cope with a new environment every now and then. One noted term that one must always remember is practicality. Even if one faces a new world and begin with a new chapter, one must always consider living by practicality. In Filipino communities, many families find it difficult to sustain their financial needs and can ill-afford send their children to college. But these students are very eager to continue their college studies, work, earn and aspire for a more comfortable life. These college students, to assist and finance their studies, work on part-time jobs. These part-time jobs are really offered to students by various business and companies, a few of these are: crew members in fast-food chains, assistant librarians or a cashier at a grocery store. Having a part-time job while studying is a real tedious task and involves a wise use of your time. Truly, working while studying and studying while working is a real sacrifice; one must sacrifice his/her free time and rest to work and study. But at the end of the day, it will always be beneficial – he/she will finish her degree course and now has the better opportunity to be employed. All their hard work will be compensated and they will be able to help others as well. Having been employed in an early age, is not a disadvantage, it also gives the edge to these working students for having a hands-on experience on these jobs. They were able to learn and understand the flow of the business or organization that they were involved in. They also gain an additional network for their social life and most importantly, they will have the money they need derived from their own hard work.', \"I was lucky enough that my parents paid for my whole college education. But I'm in line with that statement because with have a part time job we can help our parent and we have much money to buy everything we want. Beside, by doing the part job, we can get many experiences that may useful in the future. Because experience is the most important thing to get job. Moreover we can be more appreciate the money. Know that how difficult to get money. But we must can manage the time for studying and doing the part time job. Because we have to have much care about time. Everybody know that Time is Money. Managing the time is the important thing if we wont get something loss. So have part time job is important for collage student. Because many advantages that we can get from it. If we believe can do it then why not? But we have to remember that study is number one, although we have a part time job we do not lazy to studying because we can get science, experience and we can use to live in society beside as student. We have to smart to manage the time so we can take the advantages. Talk more do more and get more.\", \"I agree with the statement. There are two reasons that I support this opinion. First, part-time jobs are the only opportunity to experience what or how the job is, before entering a company. Before entering universities(even after entering them), all most no students haven't decided what type of jobs they want to do or which company they are interested in. For those students, part-time jobs are good chance to find a job which they truly want to do. And also, in Japan, once we enter a company, it's very difficult to quit the job and to find another job, even if the job is uncomfortable, but you could have many part-time jobs and quit them easily. I myself had been working in the clam school, and I learned really a lot of thing. Second, most university students don't receive their allowance from their parents, so, in fact, they have to work to earn money for leisure activity, payment of mobile phone, or dating with their boy/girl friend. And in some club whose club dues are high, all members do a part time job as a club activity. For them, part-time jobs are a very important for their daily lives. To conclude, I strongly suggest to university student that they try to experience part-time jobs as much as possible, as long as they become an obstacle to studying.\", 'I think this very important. Because college students have to work in future, if can get some experience by part-time job, I believe it good for you. In the work, can meet many different people, they maybe are your colleague, guest, and boss, you will through many thing with them, can learning many knowledge and interesting things to you. Sometime you can meet bad people, they can make trouble to you, you have to calm, don\\'t angry, try use communication with they, in this process, and you can grow up of your mind. In the other, you can get money by part-time job, it can lower home expense, so, I support college students go to do part-time job. A example, I have do part-time job in Carrefour in summer vacation and winter vacation, in my colleagues, have come from south of Taiwan, he can tall to we have very things at quit time, it are very interesting and funny, let me understand very things, in the work, can meet very much guest, someone can\\'t find the thing, but the thing at they front, someone can ask too stupid question, and the question is not any relation in my work, but after question can get a \"thanks\", I was content.', 'Part time job is some thing we do besides our regular work or studies. in modren world most of people are independet and they do part time jobs in order to get more money to full fill their basic or some do it to study by their own money. education is very costly and all the people can not afford it . so students on schlorships studying abrod or poor people do part time jobs in order to get their fees. some people do it as fun or some experience. part time job includes teaching working in a bank or some organization. I my self have taught while I was studying just for my passion. our society has some boundaries because of which some feel shy in doing work. in westren culture how ever does whatever work is appreciated. people must be hard working and most enjoy an be sincue to whatevere they do either studies or work. I personally feel as a student one must do some work doing his studying period for experience for confidence for mangement and also for his expensies to reduce burden of his parents. they can do jobs in franchise organization or may teach. part jobs are very helpfull in todays world and especially in our country as we all know the crisis. we most not feel shyness in doing any work that is respectable but most do it with intrest.', \"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons to support my stance. Firstly, a part-time job is an important chance to experience the society. Because a college is the place to prepare before going to the real society, part-time job is very necessary to know how severe working is or how we can enjoy it. In my experience, I learned that even one mistake cannot be allowed in a serves through working in bakery. I also noticed the importance of the relationship with my seniors. Second reason is a monetary problem. I think college students need a lot of money for texts or for some entertainments. However we are already adults and should not totally depend on our parents in finance. Therefore it is quite better to earn by ourselves as much as possible. As for me, I can live without working if I ask my parents to support me but I chose to work. That's because I have to learn to manage myself before graduating university. After I started to work, I actually became to think the importance of money when I buy something. Lastly, I think a part-time job is a good opportunity to get new friends. In a college, it is difficult to find so many kinds of friends because ages and departments are limited. However, if we work, we can meet any kinds of people regardless of ages or spatiality. I think such relationship is precious even after getting older. From all those reasons, I strongly believe that having a part-time job is important for college students.\", \"There are no complete agreements among the students about the view about whether we should take part-time job. Many students hold the opinion that we should have part-time jobs. However, also there are a lot of them having a different view. The people who hold the first view think it is helpful and wise to take part-time jobs. Firstly, they think they can develop their experience and capacities during working. It is obvious that this can make preparations for the job in the future. Second, they can get money on their own, cultivating their independence and skill. Finally, they can contract a lot of people and learn from them what cannot be taught in the school. But the people who take the second view don't think so, they think it's not suit for students to do part-time jobs. Students' primary task is to study, without being worsted in the knowledge which they should gain in the school; they may lose the opportunity of finding a better job after graduation. So it is not right for them to spend their energy and time on part-time job. Weighing the two kinds of views, I think it is beneficial for us to try part-time jobs but not putting all the time and energy on it.\", 'These days, fee of university is expensive. Many students are given to an exhibition or it is difficulty that having a part-time job and going to university. So, I agree to important for college students having a part-time job. First, Grow up students assists of parents. Make your pocket money and fee of university for having a part-time job. Naturally, it is difficult that concentrate of major and it is tired to less of sleeping. Immunity is weak, so you should sick but, everybody parent is not rich. So, they have a part-time job. Second, a part-time job is kind of social life. Therefore, they are experience to social life and after their graduate university, it is important to experience social life. Naturally, university life is community life. But, it is different to having part-time job. Last, you having a part-time job are realized value of money. One is non-having a part-time job; the other is having a part-time job. It is different that wastefully of money. Non-having a part-time job does not realize value of money. But, having a part-time job buy something is think about spend the money. It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Therefore, I think I agree to important for college students having a part-time job.', \"I strongly believe that students should have the urge to commit themselves on part-time jobs pertaining to those who are at the tertiary level. This is because on our century today, the tuition fees are inevitably increasing. Some parents would have a hard time paying the tuition fees of their children. To lessen the burden our parents are carrying, we must have the guts to help them. Another reason would be for students to gain experience and to develop their strengths and weaknesses. Engaging ourselves on things that we do not usually do can help improve our well-being. One's personality can be changed through socializing. Also, this can help in applying for full-time jobs in the near future. Brought by experience, one can be easily accepted on companies if they already had previous experiences most especially those types that enhance one's skills. Lastly, for some students who do not have anything to work with during their free hours, taking up a part-time job would be the best way to occupy their time with. Instead of engaging ourselves on unnecessary matters, we can help not only to our family and self but also to the own country as well. One can gain extra income for future necessities.\", 'As a college student, it is important to have a part time job. It have many benefit for them. The first benefit is it can up his / her experience about working before they have a real job. Students will need to know how they act at work place, what they must do, and how they use their ability at work. And they need to know too how they talk with the boss, what they need to do to earn a raise, and learn a socialism at their work place. The second benefit is to help their parents about school funds. Have a part time job can help students to decrease their parents works, or to up his month income. It is useful for them that live in poor families and have low month income. The third benefit is it can help the preparation of a student before they have a real job. So students will not surprised when they feel something different from working. Because the level of difficulties between the real life at work place and the college life is really different. At college, we only get frustated from the homework or study things. But at work we can get frustrated from our boss, our enemy, or even our friends.', \"Many college students have a part-time job today. It is very common circumstances and many students do their part-time job. As a student, I also agree that college students have a part-time job. I will talk about my opinion why I agree that. First, college students will get experiences about social job. They can experience hard and good things. It is very important because social experience is very useful to all people. When they are adult, they have to work and earn money. During they work, they meet many people and would be faced with hard times. So, meeting many people and building experiences are important. Second, they can get their own money. They can buy anything that they want to buy without their parent's help. And they can help their parents as they pay their tuition. If they earn money during vacation, they can get much money. Lastly, they can feel a sense of accomplishment as they do their work. So, they will work well in the future. In conclusion, as they have a part-time job, they can get social experience and help their parents. They are also able to fulfill themselves through their part-time job. So, it is important for college students to get a part-time job.\", \"It depends on the person's need. Different students have different needs. For a rich one, they do not have to consider whether they have money to live or not. However, for a poor one, having a part-time job is very important. But there are some students will have a part-time job in order to get job experiences. For me, having a part-time job is quite important. My parents cannot send too much money for me as allowance, so if I want to buy some new stuff, go to the restaurant or go traveling, etc. I have to deal with the spending myself. But having part-time jobs is not only to earn some money as allowance but also to get some experiences. Therefore, I always make myself have two part-time jobs during each semester. One, the key-in job, is for my daily lives, and another, school office helper, is for the experience. Both of them are simple jobs and can earn 95 NT dollars at each hour. Although, having a part-time job, for some students, is quite important. Safety is also important. That is why my two part-time jobs are both provided from my school, NCCU. The importance of having part-time jobs is different from different students. As long as you need, then just go to find one. But we college students all have to remember not only taking the responsibility to the job but protect ourselves\", \"In the last years, college students taking a part-time job become very popular in the big city. Many people believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. But I disagree with it. I have some reason to support my idea. Firstly, I hold that everyone should have the most important thing to be done in the different period. To be a student, study is the key word for us. If you cannot study well, you waste your time. Secondly, lots of students want to lessen their parents' financial burden through taking a part-time job. But it has a bad effect on their study. They do not know the most important thing their parents respect is that they can learn well and live a better life after they graduate. Therefore, pay much attention on your study now. The most important thing is not to have a part-time job right now, learn professional skills and practice yourself is the most serious thing in the university. If you want to earn more money, this will really help you later. So don't be influenced by others and try to keep on learning knowledge and you will succeed in the future.\", 'I agree with the preceding statement. Because, I think that college students need a lot of money. I have two reasons for it. First, They should buy as many as books and read them. They can study a lot of things from the many books. If they go to the library, they can read the many books, but they are forbidden writing in the books of library. I think writing in the books for studying is very important. Therefore, college students need much money to buy a lot of books. Second, they need to make many friends. To make a friend, they will belong to a club. On the club activities, they will need much money. If they get friend, they enjoy eating and drinking with their friends. In summer vacation, they will plan to have a trip in overseas. I think college students need to studying and playing. A part-time job gives them not only the money but also the wonderful experiences. It is the very precious things that working in the society, and finding the various things. For example, they feel the importance for responsible for them work and difficulty with getting a money. I think college students should have a part-time job, and study a lot of things.', \"Why many college students decide to do a part-time job although they can only learning and use their free time to rest. Some student must work a part-time job because of their family credit, while others do a part-time job because they want to. Personally, I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job First of all, the students that have a part-time job can get some money to share the work of their family and they can develop many important skills to become a good worker, such as responsibility, punctuality and self-command. They also learn how to work with other people and gain many experience from older workers. Most importantly, when the college students graduate and want to find a job. The students who had a part-time job in the past are more interesting than the other whom not. Especially, the students that did a lot of past-time jobs for many years, it's a proof of diligence of them. However, there are some students who do a part-time job brush away to learn in campus. They must to memorize that the reason why they are students is to learn to find a good work in the future. In my opinion, I don't think that do a part-time job while learning can make any problems if they use their time worthily. In conclusion, I think that a part-time job is the first step to the key of success.\", \"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are several reasons. First, you can earn money in your own. When we grow up, the entire bill about studying was paid by our parents. Usually one enters the college at the age of eighteen. Eighteen years old means you are an adult. You should share the economical load of your family. You can use the money to pay for your registration and learn to be independent. Second, you can learn how to deal with problems encountered in your work. When you solve these problems, you can get experiences. Those experiences will one day help you when you graduate from school. Last, you can make friends from your work. A good friend will be help of you future work, especially when you are in trouble. He can save you when you need help. But as a student, your primary goal is get good grade to pass the exam. So don't spend too much time at part-time job. You need time to study and go to class. Try to distribute your time among class, part-time job, playing and rest! Those things must be balanced. Or you will be regret in the future.\", \"These days, a lot of students have part-time jobs. On the Internet and newspapers, many companies are looking for students to work for them. I don't think, however, it is a good idea for students to work part-time while they are going to school. I also don't think it is necessary, because parents support them and pay for their expenses. In addition, having jobs has some negative effects. First of all, education is difficult and complex. To learn and get good grades, students have to study hard. They have to get up early to attend classes, and do their homework at home. It seems to be easy, but it is busy and hard. If students are working part-time after class, they are going to be tired, so it impacts on the next day. It will have negative effects on studying: they won't concentrate, and they will even be able to doze in class. Finally, it will impact on their grades. Finally, if a student works part-time, he may miss out on the fun of his life. He won't be able to play with his friends and enjoy his own spare time. In other words, if a student spends time on working, he can't enjoy his life. I think that a period of students is the freest time except studying. This is because their parents pay for their expenses, and parents help everything that they want. Therefore, students have to concentrate on studying. In conclusion, students' duty is studying. They have to study rather than work because having part-time jobs has some negative effects as above. A period of students is a favorable time to study.\", 'I feel it is important for college students to have a part time job Important or not important is according to their economy situation, ambitions, and many others reasons. If their parent rich maybe it is not too important because they can paid all of the college cost, and books. But if they are a poor family or middle maybe sometimes they need to do a part time job to add their income, or maybe they want something more. Some college students sometimes have a part time job to fulfill their ambitions to be a richer man, but I think study is more important for college students than doing a part time job. Because the smarter they are the faster they will finish their course, and they will save more money because they not repeat their course, they will ready to face a better job, be more serious than before because they do not need to split their concentration with their part time job and study time. For poor students of course a part time job is important because they need more money to pay for the college cost, for their books, and their transportation. Generally some students do noy take a part time job seriously.', 'It\\'s not. But it never ceases to amaze me how many ordinary people believe that it is and then they regurgitate an awful lot of these boring old wives tales like; character building, responsibility, work experience etc. What a load of bollocks. It is quite simply a case by case scenario really and that\\'s all it is. Those that need a few extra quid for university fees, college fees, books, party cash or living expenses, work part-time jobs and those who are cashed up, don\\'t. That\\'s it in a nutshell really and end of story. If they just want work experience, then they choose to work in a career related company during the holidays. I honestly can\\'t understand what all the kerfuffel is about when they rave on about character building either. I mean, if I want character building, then I\\'ll join the military or a religious sect. I am not going to build much character stacking shelves in the evenings or delivering newspapers at 4AM in the morning when I should be sleeping, studying or both. Where I come from, if I was in a job interview and told the interviewer that I delivered newspapers in the mornings they would probably say, straight off the bat, \"Oh I see, no cash hey?\" It\\'s not important to have a part-time job at all for college purposes unless you need the cash. Period!', \"I agree with this statement, and I think that college students should have a part-time job. I have three reasons for this. First, they can learn a lot trough having a part-time job, and it will be useful in their future. For example, I worked at a Hotel as a service stuff in banquet. Through this job I could notice that it is not easy to earn money, and I felt appreciate to my parents, because they have worked for me since I was born. If I hadn't have a part-time job, I would never get such a feeling. This is one lesson from my working experience, but I believe every college student can learn something important through doing a job. So in my opinion, college students should have a part-time job. Second, having a part-time job gives them a lot of information about the occupation. Then if they have a several kinds of jobs in their university days, they can know what kind of jobs they really want to do in the future. I mean that having a part-time job brings happy lives for college students. Third, I think students have to have a part-time job, and earn money by their selves, because college students need a lot of money for trip, study, or play with their friends. However, they should not make their parents pay all of them. They should try to independent from their parents. So, they have to work in order to earn the money that they need. In conclusion, from these three reasons, I believe that having a part-time job is important for college students.\", \"I think that college students have a part-time jab before graduating from university. Because they didn't have any experience about a part-time job, they will be embarrassed in society. In my case when I was a fresh man, I worked Lotto Riau as a part time worker for one year. And my parents recommended me to have a part-time job before going to army. I think it was good experience for me to meet various people and got little money. Even though I got living money from my parents, that was not enough to live. But since I had a part-time job, I could live better than I didn't have it. There is a bad aspect. It means I couldn't concentrate on my study. After working for 6 months, I thought whether I stop working or not. My choice was keep it going. At that time, I was young. So I had many chance in future and I had to go to army. Now I don't regret it. If I turn a fresh man, I would work also. Some people think having a part-time job is spent time in their life. Otherwise people who would have a part-time job, they will be succeed than no having experience. If you are living in Korea, I want you to have a part-time job when you are young.\", \"Part time job has both a positive side and negative side for college students. Part-time jobs can add to the experience for students, but on the other side part-time jobs only add laziness students to gain knowledge in lectures and feared student can not complete the task well. Work part-time foster learning lazy mind, a desire to pursue money, envious, spiteful, selfish and arrogant. Thoughts chase the money is actually very good for the students for future work later when the students will demonstrate his perseverance in working. I think the better part-time work directly supervised by the college or the work is equated with the task of lectures. With the formula so students can feel how hard the atmosphere in employment and foster independence stance while also students also become more cautious in the work, students can also consult directly with the supervisor or lecturer of the course if there is a problem in the job. Part time job that has been set by the college are expected to not disrupt student learning and fostering students' positive thoughts. In general I support the idea of part time work for college students on condition that the job will not lead to failure in their studies.\", \"When teenagers were high school students, they have less responsibility, less self-dependency, and they are still living in their comfort zone. Therefore, as soon as they step into college life, they have stepped into adulthood as well. As an adult, they have to be independent, able to take care of themselves, and take bigger responsibility for their own life. That is why college students should have a part time job. There are three reasons why they should have a part time job; to learn to not be dependent on one's parents, to be able to work, and to learn to have their responsibility as an adult. First of all, by taking a part time job, high school students who just turned into college students can be independent and learn to not lean on their parents anymore since they will part from them later on. Second, by taking a part time job, they can learn about working and earning money. Although part time job is a small job, but it can give them a picture of how working world is and how they make a living through it so that later when they are working in a company or starting their own business, they already know how to adapt and what to do. Lastly, through the part time job, they can learn on how to be responsible to themselves, by doing their work properly, and to others who are related to the part time job, the costumers, the managers, and co-workers. That is why college students should take a part time job.\", \"I agree with the statement. There are three reasons. First, college students need a lot of money. They must pay money to college. And it needs to buy cloths, and to eat, drink in order to be friendly. They should not have their parents to pay a lot for them. They should pay the costs by themselves. So they should have a part-time job. Second, they can make friends when they work. To work together, they will become friendly. It is very good to have many friends. For example, when he or she has a problem, he or she can want the friends to advice. Their advice might be different from college friends. It is important to hear many kinds of advice. Finally, it is able to practice for their job in future to have a part-time job. If they have not have a part-time job, they don't know what kind of job is good for them. To have a part-time job is good chance to notice them. Some people might say that they can study more if they don't have that. It is true. However, I think it is more important to have that. They will be good person. It is why I agree with the statement.\", \"I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have part-time job. Of course, college students have to study. But study isn't all they have to do. They also have to experience a lot of things before they graduate the colleges and begin to work. For example, reading books, listening music, playing sports, and trip. In regard to trip, they can go where they haven't visited, see what they haven't seen and feel something special. College students are not children but also not adults. Time during college student is time to experience and feel a lot of things. And so, they prepare to become perfect adults. For that, they need some money. They have to prepare money they need by themselves, because they aren't children. Their parents mustn't give them money and they mustn't depend on help of their parents. To use money they work and get is important. Through using money they work and get, they can know importance of money and way to use money. That's why they have to have part-time job.\", \"Have you ever get to part time after teenagers? Most teenagers want to make money without supporting their parents. In my case I could lots of advantages when I worked in a part time job. First of all, I could make different kinds of relationships. As you know, if I got a new circumstance, we could meet many people. Every people makes you learn valuable things whether you like each person or not. Second, I could have good skills from a part time job. If you work at restaurant kitchen, you could cook foods well. Also, if you work apparel store in department store, you could give people good services and could match clothe well depending on each situation or purpose. Finally, you can learn how valuable money is and how to deal with money well. If you take money from your parents, you just waste money easily. However, if you earn money for yourself to buy something, you couldn't use your money easily and think very carefully when you decide to use that. Through my experiences, if you have an opportunity to work in a part time job, you can learn economical advantage and social advantage in your life.\", 'Part time work is important to students. Although work is different, such as sales workers, etc. But what is to come back. A valuable experience not available in the classroom. Today, finding of new graduates is difficult for most companies work hard to individuals with experience. To have work experience it is important to students. In time to finish the university. Students then have not less. To find work during school. This is a job for a lot. May be employed through the university or find a supplier to the self. Examples of working part time at 7-eleven the service. Those from the expertise of working in your career, human relationships and learn to correct errors and self-development. Therefore say that. Experience from the work that has value. Depending on the students themselves that are working hard. To experience from working much. Students have many different reasons to want to work like money to do anything for leisure. Concluded that experience by working part time are important things to be back is knowledge shall be self Human relationships with colleagues. Learn about working hours and break time, knowledge and expertise in that line all to improve and develop their own following.', 'Is a part time job important to university students? As a university student, I do not have a part time job. But I do think a part time job is quite essential to an undergraduate. There are several reasons behind. Firstly, university fees are high. Having a part time job, a student can earn money in order to pay for part of the fees in the university. This can ease the strain of the bread winner of the family. Secondly, having some working experience before graduated can be an advantage when you apply for jobs in the future. Employers in all companies will prefer to employ a person with rich experience than a person with none. Thirdly, having a part time job can practice the time management skill of a student. If you can do well in academic result and at the same time doing well in your part time job. You will absolutely be an expert in time management. As a result, a part time job is important to a university student. If you your academic result will be affected by having a part time job, it is better you stick to your studies rather than having a part time job.', 'I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Of course, I have a part-time job. A part-time job must be a valuable experience. Many high school students are banned to have a part-time job. Even if they want to work, their parents and teachers ban to do. But, college students are free to do and have a lot of time. They should have a part-time job unless they are absent from the class because of it. Through a part-time job, I learned a difficulty of earning. Therefore, I learned to use money very carefully. This is an important thing in my life. Some people who did not have a part-time job when they are college students will not know the difficulty until they get a job. It is too late. People do not apt to forget things which they learned when they were young. My mother said It is very valuable for young people to have a trouble. So, we should experience many things and get a correct view, the right way to think and so on. They who acquired them will live comfortably from now. A great life waits for them.', \"Study is more important than other for all people in the word. Because with study especially study in the school, we can get a lot of knowledge, a lot of friend, a lot of experience etc. for example in Indonesia a necessary study is nine years. But in the reality, all poor people can't continue their study because they don't have much money. There is one factor who constraint student to have a part time job, especially a student in university. They must have a part time job. Why I say like that ? because, first not all student in university, who the parents do not pay them. Second, if we have a part time job, we can study to manage our time, so that their time can regulary. Third, if we have a part time job, we can help our parents to pay our study in university. And we can live with ourselves, and we do not always to announce with the other people especially our parents. The conclusion for the important of college student to have a part time job is if we have a part time job, we can help our parents to pay our study in university, we can manage our time, and we can study about we can't announce with our parents forever.\", 'Now I am studying at Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai, Thailand. I am studying in school of liberal arts English major. I agree with part time job. Part time job can make teenagers increase responsibility, develop their own personalities. Teenagers who work part time job can practice to be careful when they meet many kind people and they will know benefit of money, how hard to earn it. I agree with a part time job. The first reason is part time job can help teenagers preparing life to adult that must have more responsibility. When teenagers take a part time job must have responsibility to manage time for study, relax, work, and travel. Second the young can learn how to life with other people, ad just the unfamiliar environment. Third teenagers learn what that she or he want to be in the future. They can plan what they have to learn that useful for their future job. Finally, teenager will know benefit or money, how hard to earn it, I think that no one wants to waste the money that they have to exchange by their effort. In conclusion, part time job is the good idea to prepare the young change to adult. I hope that the schools or universities and parents will support young people to work part time job.', \"Having a part-time job during university, it provides lots of personal and social benefits. Not only university students can take the advantages, but also the society. Hence, no matter what, it is essential for whose students to have a part-time job. For students themselves, on one hand, they get many of individual advantages. They earn money for their daily lives that learn to become financial independent. Also, teenagers can experience the real society before graduation. It's a rare opportunity to build up their own network, which benefits them a lot in future. Moreover, it's easier for them to set up targets after having working experience. For commercial society, on the other hand, the higher education level had, the higher salary offered. Due to lack of liquids, but, it's hard for small companies to employ educated elits. So, undergraduaters are suitable choices for these campanies. They are not only well-educated, but they also have more creativity than adults who work for many years. Meanwhile, teenagers have a chance to practice their creativity and critical thinking. All in all, based on the points I have mentioned above, it's worth and important for university students to have a part-time job.\", \"Today, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. It told us different people hold different viewpoints. Some people agree with the idea of topic A, which part-time job is very good for college students. In my opinion, it is not so important for college students to have part-time jobs. I have some reasons to prove my point. Some people think there are some advantages if students take part-time jobs. They think that many students gain experience from part-time job. Some people even say they can have practice some good characters. On the other hand, students can earn money from doing part-time jobs. If they are from very poor family, they can reduce their family burden. But after-school work has brought a lot of problems. For example, some students all the time think of their part-time jobs and cannot decide study is more important now. So some students now have some problems with study and some even don't go to class on time. As for me, I think the main task of students is to study hard and learn important knowledge. They can earn money later. So college students now need to know what are more important is study.\", \"I agree with this statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons. In the first, many college students don't have money but they need much money for their food, clothing and shelter, playing with theirs friends, going anywhere and buying anything which they want. But when they use theirs money to buy something, theirs parents don't always give some money to them. So they need to have a part-time job. By the working they can get some money, also experience selling products and services and learn the difficulties in earning money. It is the first reason. The second reason is that the wage for the college students is cheaper than other workers. So if college students work part time, many companies and shops do without paying higher wage to employments. But now the condition of business is very bad in Japan. Some people think because of the college students part-time, many unemployed people miss their opportunities to work and the unemployed rate is high. Certainly the population of workforce doesn't contain the number of college students and the part-time by college students causes the rise of the unemployed rate. But it is said that business in the world is the worst for a hundred year. So when business gets good the unemployed people now will be able to get theirs works and the unemployed people will be less than now. By college students part-time, many companies and shops can decreased the payment of employee's wage. So I agree with the statement.\", \"Special weekend or part-time work The answer is very good for someone who is looking for quick money. The addition of recurring revenue. This is the main reason people often choose to work extra part time jobs, which are a part time job that has to do in the labor market, most often pay wages sensitivity and high yield. Wanting to resolve the financial problems as well. Part time job is to use free time to benefit as income. Creating a positive work habits. About time management for maximum benefit. Rather than let life pass from day to day. With nonsense Because each day. We have at least 8 hours, which we always leave time to leave unfortunately. We can work part time or extra work is just work part time Sat - Sun To generate extra income for families on the other hand, generation of IT work part time on the Internet happens a lot. Can be doing at home. Work your own schedule. To have more time with family. Because after that deal with everyday life is complete the remaining time than the rest deservedly can also allocate time to part time work has continued as well. Another advantage of the extra work part time student is admitted to practice before the real work in future. Many people who have worked extra Have work experience when applying for jobs are often higher will be considered for work before others, always This is due to the recruitment company. Do not want to start a new training sure enough. In addition, money and experience that can't find the Part-time working. Part-time working is also helping a patient, responsibility and honesty. Finally, you will get the trust of parents and become adults to work effectively in the future.\", \"College student should do part time job. Part time job is one of the choices that can make your free time useful. Making your free time useful is very valuable. When you see a work that you have done by yourself will make you feel proud of yourself and it also give some willpower to force you to keep it up. Once you feel like that, you will try to do it better and better to show your potentiality. Somehow this kind of work may show you some potentiality in yourself that you never know before. Your potentiality in yourself is untouchable but it valuable than many thing in this world that can be touch. You can also get some money from part time job. Money is not the most important thing but it is one of the sources that make our life survive. Some families have to face a money problem about tuition fee and living expense. This little money from part time job may not help all of the problems but at least it may help student to have a tuition fee. That is a wonderful experience for college student! Working with many people will also give you an experience because everybody has different thought. So, you will see many different way of thinking which may adapt to use with yourself to improve your way of thinking and also make your thought grow faster. Finally, part time job have a lot of advantages not only to yourselves but it also give an advantage to your future. Everybody grows and learns from experience and this kind of job will give you a lot of experience. So, this break semester don't forget to take out this choice from your mind to make your time and your life more valuable.\", \"Now many parents and teachers disagree that college students have their own part-time jobs. Because they are believe that students will spend their study-time on working. But I do not think so, I think a part-time job is one of the most important things in college life. It will be the precious experience in your whole life. Firstly. Part-time job is a good way to fill your spare time after class. Many students spend time on shopping, singing or playing computer games which are pointless. Why do not we take a part-time job to instead of those entertainment ? We can even earn some money from the job by ourselves at least. Secondly. Part-time job can adds your career experience, which is a very useful part in your future life after you graduate. You will learn much knowledge that can not be found in school lessons. Social experience is the biggest chip for graduated students when they interview jobs, it's easier to find jobs for those who have accumulated experiences in part-time jobs. Thirdly. As a matter of fact, a lot of college students from poor families, so taking a part-time job for them is one of the way to afford their college fees. Although the money may be not enough, but that is all they have earned by themselves. From what I have said, it is important to college students to have a part-time job. Study also must be pay attention too, so we should balance the part-time job and study well, after all, the first job of students is study.\", \"I agree that it is important for college students have a part-time job even though I have never worked at a part-time job. Nowadays, most of college students have to spend a huge amount of registration fee to study in university. The price of registration fee is approached almost \\\\400-500. However, they don't have any ability to pay this. So, their parents have to shoulder the entire costs instead of them. If students work at part-time jobs, they would lighten their burden. I think it is also one of the ways to help parents. The other reason why I agree on it is that it can help to gain a lot of experience for students' careers. For employment, many companies demand lots of careers to students. It would be one of good experiences to have part-time jobs. Also, students who work part-time job can learn how to treat people and to do social life, like that. In addition, they can develop their personality like diligence, manners, sense, and partnership. That's why it is important for college students have a part-time job. Some people worry about that it disturbs student's study. But, students belong to part-time job have to control their time and strength themselves.\", \"In high school, most of the school doesn't suggest their students for doing the part time job. I think that's because some of the students who was doing a part time job still couldn't manage their time effectively. In fact, their score are decreasing because of that. We are students whose first priority is studying. If part time job give bad effect to our score, I think it is better to stop doing a part time job. But now, we are college students. We have to manage our time wisely. We should consider that doing a part time job can give us many advantages. With part time job, we can help our parent for searching for money. And, instead of collecting money, experience is more wonderful present we got from doing the part time job. Experience can help us doing many things and making a conclusion. Experience is required too in searching for the real job. Nowadays, there are many college students that do part time job beside college and doing well in both college and part time job. If we could do them both, don't be hesitated. Do both college and part time job. It really gave us precious experience we need. It is important for college students to have a part time job.\", \"The previous arguments always focus on the necessity of college students having a part-time job. With people's more and more awareness of the benefits of having a part-time job, they all support their children to have one in their universities. In today's society, however, a part-time job is becoming necessary in a college school student's life. Money is needed now more than ever. A number of teenagers are entering the workforce. The modern times in which we live accommodate the need for teenagers to have their own source of income. A part-time job not only enables students to promote their abilities, but also help them apply their knowledge to practice. Furthermore, students who have part-time jobs can relieve that the economic burdens of their parents. Your studies should remain your main focus, but if you have the chance to earn some money and gain experience while you're in school. In my opinion, students can choose to take up a part-time job according to their own situation. The most important thing for them is to keep a good balance between part-time jobs and his study. Taking advantage of a part-time job in the college does practice yourself. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job if they do it properly.\", 'In present many teenagers use the money to wasteful so some teenagers find for the method in order to give more money to use. That method is having part time job after school. Teenagers be trained about science and theories at school is not enough to prepare them for adult life, parents must think about a way to make them familiar with the older, tougher and wider world by the encouraging them to take a part - time job. Once in a while I indulge and spoil myself with something expensive. Since I was working, my mother declared that she was cutting off my allowance. When she was still giving me allowance, the phrase spending money like water was all too familiar with me. There was this a little store in the mall called Sanrio Surprises where all my money would flow. Anything new there was what I invested my precious allowance in. It did not even matter what it was or how I was going to get it; I just had to get it no matter what. The best reason for encourage the teenager to take a part time job is to make them learn how hard money is earned.', \"In my opinion, having a part time job in college is not a priority. Focusing on studies instead is. Unless absolutely necessary, for example if the student is on his own having to earn money for his needs, I believe that having a part-time job is a great distraction from education and will slowly but surely take a toll on the student's health. First of all, having a part-time job takes away one's time for study and rest. How would a day in the life of a college student with a part-time job be like? I 'm quite sure it is similar to a varsity player's. The student would go to school, eat, go to work, finish requirements and before he knows it, the day's up. He'll go to school again with only a few hours of sleep and not be able to concentrate in the discussions. Even while working, he will not be able to perform well. Even if he can, he would still be worried and stressed out about school and the work load given by his proffessors. By simply having a part-time job, he puts his education at risk when in fact, his education is what will get him a good job in the future. Although having a part-time job forces the student to be responsible, to learn time management and to work quickly and efficiently given a short period of time and at the same time enables the student to earn money, that path will be extremely tough. He will need a brain fully-rested, not sleep-deprived. He will have to sacrifice a number of things. He will be going through a lot already even as a student. It would be physically, mentally and emotionally better if college students do not have prioritize having part-time jobs just yet.\", \"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays many college students have a part-time job. Some students did it for keep their experience, make money or for fun. But I think part-time job not good for all college students, it good for some students only. Because if college students did a part-time job they will have effect on their study and they don't have time to read or practice their learning. For some students can not arrange their time and have a bad grade, they should not did a part-time job. But if they want to do it they will wait for a good time, for example summer, holiday or their free time. Because they should keep time for study and read book. Moreover part-time job is have a good point also. It is students can make money by themselves. And they can help their parent about income and save money of family. When they need something they can buy it buy themselves don't have to disturb their parent. Whatever part-time job is not important for college students because students must be learn and grow up follow by their age. Job will make students grow over age. And if college students have problem about money for study they can request scholarship. Today have a many scholarship for poor students and good students. I think scholarship is better than college students did a part-time job.\", \"In today's modern society, more and more students are earning for their allowances. Besides, many employers want to hire the person who has the working experience before entering into their companies. Thus, with a working experience for students is important. As we can see in the colleges, most of the students have a part-time job when they study in the school. They not only want to earn for their livings, but also accumulate their working experience. This experience especially plays an important role while writing their resumes. When they want to enter a company in the future, many employers look at the section, working experience, in the resumes. The more experience you have, the much easier you can get the entrance ticket to your favorite company. And that's the reason why the college students want to have a part-time job while studying. Take me for example, now I'm a college student, and I'm seeking for a part-time job in the summer vocation. In order to broader my working experience, I have tried many kinds of tasks which are totally different, such as a reception In the World Trade Center and a telephone caller in the cram school. In my opinion, once I have done more jobs, I would have more chance to enter into my favorite firm. By extending the working experience, it is important to have a part-time job for a college student. Moreover, once the experience accumulates, the employer would have a desire to employee you in the future!\", \"Having a part-time job is important for college student. In my opinion, there are several benefits from the part-time job experience. First, without a doubt, the spending such as the money for food, grocery, pleasure and so on, all that from college students is a large number. Therefore, taking part-time job can not only release the economical pressure to family but also make students take the responsibility for them. Second, many forth-grade students who are about to graduate worry their future for jobs, therefore, taking part-time jobs before graduation helps students collect social experience and have chance to close to every work of life. Through this way, college students are more likely to find out their true interest in fields of works, this may explain the reason why many students after graduation are not in the relevant fields they learned in campus. Otherwise, part-time jobs offer another learning opportunity for students. Don't look down on any job; every job is filled with knowledge and values. Take servants for example, if students have jobs in restaurants, they should learn how to deal with many unexpected problems, including keeping smile and patience while blamed by boss or costumers. As time goes by, students would become more mature and good at solving problems wisely. Are you a college student? Do you have a part-time job? If not, why not find a part-time job right now?\", 'Some people believe that as college students, we should not have part-time jobs as that will leave us less time on our studies, which is what our primary responsibility is. However, I agree that it is beneficial for college students to have a part-time job, if they have good time management. Firstly, getting a part-time job is the first step to learning how to be independent, and university is the best time to do so. As university course choices and education is more self-directed than in junior college or high school, most college students have much free time on their hands. Having a part-time job is thus a good way of making use of their time wisely, and earning their own income at the same time. Secondly, a part-time job can act as a bridge between college education and their careers in the future. This is especially so when their part-time job coheres with what they hope to do in the future, for example, some students may choose to take up a part-time job in healthcare institutions if their course of study is healthcare-related such as nursing, medicine or pharmacy. Their part-time jobs will allow them to get a better understanding of how the industry/organisation really works, and thus makes their learning more meaningful. Even if their part-time jobs are different from their courses of study, students will still be able to learn universal skills like teamwork, communication skills and the importance of spending money wisely that will help them in their future. In conclusion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. ', \"In order to be an independent adult, we have to work in our student life. We will get much money and experience. Learning how to live in the world. For example, I had three part time job in my school life. First part time job is a guide. My work is taking Japanese tourist to go around Taipei City. I love traveling, so I enjoy the part time job. It's interested to me. Second part time job is a cram school teacher. I have to teach junior high school student geography. The work is more difficult than the first part time job. I have to promote their geography of test grade. If students don't to learn the subject, I would be disturbed by student's parents and the cram school other teachers. Not only make high geography of test grade, but also to edit new geography textbook. It's not easy to me. Third part time job is KFC's clerk. The work is a busy part time job. I have to clean tables, introduce set, and fry the chicken. I hate the job, so after 3 month I quit the part time job. Although I have some bad experience, it's still important to me. These experience abundant my life.\", \"God has sent us in this world with a great purpose. And our holy prophet (PBUH) was a also sent with this purpose which was teaching and learning. In the beginning is it was very easy to get knowledge but with the passage of time it has become very difficult to acquire it. Because of the expenses of the study. People are facing lot of problem because of their earning and it is very difficult for them to manage daily bread. But as we know this is age of science and technology. Everybody wants to get more and more education. But due to insufficient income of their parents and some other worse circumstances they have to do part time jobs to meet their expenses. That's why these many students are doing part time job during their studies. It is very difficult for them to manage two very tiresome task. They are compelled to do part time jobs but it is necessary for them. The adverse circumstances taught them lot of things about like during their studies. They become very mature at very early age. But it is very sad because they can't pay full attention towards their studies. Sometime some students do very hard jobs which made them very much fatigue. And after doing some hard job they can't do their studies properly. It is very sad because our government is not doing something in this regard. As the days are passing the expenditure of studies is going increase. The Govt. should give some cession to the students in studies or at last provide some suitable jobs which are not very hand or difficult. And it should not be like that who prove students just to get money. And they deliberately don't pay full attention to their studies or left it incomplete.\", \"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. When we talk about the part-time job, I usually think about the job in the internet that is not safety in everything such as, employer, task or process of work and money. Why I think that, because to work in part-time job we doesn't know the employer before. However the part-time job doesn't mean the job on the internet only but it means any job from anywhere. I think that a part-time job is important to many people while it not important to many people also. The case of college students I think it not important to have a part-time job because, we got a pocket money from their parents. Therefore, it not necessary to have a part-time job but I don't mean a part-time job is not good. I think that it very necessary for many college students also because, we must do not forget it at most of college students are poor. Therefore, they need to have a part- time job for get more money for pay daily life, it is very necessary for them. In conclusion, I think it depends on how necessary for working part-time job, it is very personal reason to do that.\", \" Since the mankind has come into existence ALLAH provided everything but when the humans didn't obeyed ALLAH orders, they payed for their deeds. So from that day every human worked In different forms for his provisions. Some were successful in it and some are still trying hard to meet their both ends. Part time job is one of those different forms of works i. e. doing jobs at a place for few hours and being payed for it, from which billions of people are earning their provisions. Generally, it is done to have that extra cheese or cream in your life, which will make your life more tempting and attractive. But sometimes it is done to meet all the expenses at the end of the month, and in fewer exceptions people do it as a hobby. Turning their spare time in the form of cash. Nothing is perfect in this world so same is the scenario with part time job. It has its good part and worst ones too. Good part is that you have a little bit handsome amount of money in your hands in short time. you are not spending your time like a couch potato. High turnovers, no consistency in quality are few of the ones to be highlited.\", 'It is necessary that college students have a part-time job. The major purpose of college is education, thus, the college must provide a safe environment and a peaceful learning place. Because of the safe environment at school, students are always protected from the ruthless social reality about the work, so they can not observe that what differences do it has when students are in workplace and educational place. Students can get skills which are important in work attitude in workplace and increase their patience in order to deal with troubles, also they will be understand how to find out the relation between the part-time job and all the knowledge they learnt in their college. Most of all, a part-time job for college students can make them actively get friends and expand their eyesight, so they will not set their target too small and narrow in future. In all effects that college students have a part-time job, I guess the most important and deepest one is about work attitude and patience. Even someone is smart or learned, he or she will easily be in troubles if he or she lacks any one of the above. Frankly speaking, the learning of getting alone with people will always be important and difficult than the learning of knowledge. We can compare workplace with the new college that proffers learning of human relations. From a part-time job, we can learn more skills about how to live well in workplace.', 'I agree to a limited extent that college students should have a part-time job. Part-time jobs that actively look into recruiting students usually belong to the service, food and beverage and retail industries. The jobs offered are usually on shift-basis with a minimum number of working days and working hours, giving students a considerable amount of flexibility when planning their schedule for the week or the month. Having a part-time job provide learning experiences for the student that they otherwise would not experience in school. Work commitment, managing relationships with colleagues, time management, stress management and learning new skills are some of the things a student can gain if they were to have a part-time job. By joining the workforce earlier, the student may enjoy an easier transition from their role as a student to being part of the workforce upon graduation. In addition, working part-time also encourages the student to be financially independent by earning their own allowance. However, having a part-time job can be time consuming because of the weekly commitment. The time that could have been allocated to assignment research or exam revision could be significantly compromised because of the job requirements. In addition, the fatigue and lack of rest can lead to unproductivity when the student eventually settles down to finish their schoolwork. This may impact their results and harm their progress in their studies. To conclude, I would recommend students to only look for a part-time job if they have limited income at home. Otherwise, students should fully immerse themselves in college life and enjoy the facilities while they have the luxury of time to do so. It is more important to enjoy their role as a student and to excel in it rather than to focus on getting a part-time job. ', \"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because college students have to learn something example how to make money, and Spend own money. If do not work is unable to realize the money the significance, will cause itself only randomly to spend money. Certainly because some university students the Gary economic agent can not but work earn the living expenses are also one of reasons. But works may not too surpass own elevating capacity, in order to avoid the schoolwork could not bear, instead the gain does not equal the loss, like this lost the significance which worked. Although present's university student will have more than half person to go to work, but will work with the studies proper attention to both person are not actually many, although will work may shift to an earlier time the attempt different society experience in the student profession, may also lighten some burdens for the parents, but if too will take seriously to work lets the studies be unable to give dual attention leads is only unable to graduate, instead will make itself to increase the expense which will repair, if will therefore let the student assign works with the studies time can conflict not mutually, will be very important.\", \"It is true that having a part time job is one of those important things of University life. Student with part time jobs can often earn extra money and get different experiences through various ways. With a part time job, students could earn their own money, rather than keep getting financial aids from their parents. They can be financial independent and get involved in own fiscal planning and management. On the other hand, part time jobs are relative to different skills training and experiences. Students could have specific skills been trained by taking part in different types of jobs. According to the job nature, they may have experiences of being a tutor teacher, a waiter or waitress, a salesperson and of course anything you can imagine. Most of the experiences can help in future occupation, but one important point is does it related to your study or future planning? However, many others may claim that part time jobs are time consuming, and students at different stages of study should put academy at the front. From my viewpoints, University students should have good time managements, if not, part time job is a good chance for them to learn; also, nowadays we concern on multi-competencies, and that's why we have to study in University. Having part time job is a fantastic way to earn, and that should be proposed.\", \"I'm all for part time job. Todays, Most of the students are having a part time job because they can't live with pocket money of their parent. And we don't have enough money to go to university. Entry money is so expensive, too. So we cannot but having a part time job. I have a part time job, too. If the entry pay will be low, We don't have to get a part time job. But, now. The entry money is expensive. so poor students should have a part time job. And It will help to raise an independence. While we are having it, we can earn some money for myself. For an example, it will be good to have such experience of working at a store, when they want to open such stores. However there is demerit of having jobs that is accumulation of stress. Because we cannot earn much money in a short time. Finally, if you have a dream what you want to do, you can choose the right part time job. So you can experience it before you come true your dream. So I agree to have a part time job in the univ. Accordingly, I made my position to agree with this idea.\", \"Nowadays, there are many college students who take part in the part-time jobs. Some people think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. To me, it is not a good idea. To have a part-time job is not as important as to make a great achievement in study. Having a part-time job means that you don't have enough time to study. As a result of this, the quality of education will decline and many students cannot process enough professional knowledge suitable for future work. Meanwhile, many students can earn extra money from their part-time job. Therefore, they have gotten into a habit that spends their money unreasonably. Since they have worked hard for their money, they think they deserve a luxury life instead of studying after working for a whole day. How can a tired student study hard in his or her lessons?In a word, the disadvantages of having a part-time job for a college student outweigh the advantages of it. We can't only focus on the working experience of a student. Instead, the knowledge in the professional field is more important when we are still students. So we should try to pay more attention to our study now rather than do some part-time jobs.\", \"Part time job is a way to look for my job. We can also experience many jobs through the part time job. It is very important to experience other jobs because we don't know that what we are interested in and want to be. So I think it is very good ways. I had part time jobs several times. It was very hard experiences but it is great time for me. When I needed money I sold clothes last year. I worked on the department store. It was very hard and I really wanted quit so fast. But I needed money to travel abroad so I couldn't do that. When I was 21, I worked at theater. It was very interesting times but I stressed about money. Because I checked money and calculated money exactly the theater earned money. I also worked at buffet. The work was very hard but eating delicious food was very good. Sometimes people gave me tip so I thought it was a cool job. Few months ago, I taught middle school students. It was hard work too because middle school students were not listen my speeches. I think many jobs that I experienced are going to be good sources in my future. Someday, you can experience many part time jobs too.\", \"I don't agree if college students have a part time job and in my opinion there are several reasons. The first reason is because it can broke focus of students in studying. The second reason it is so difficult to balance both of them - studying and working Consequently, one of them will become victim. Because when students have problem, it certainly will affect on the other side. If the reason of students working to get experience, surely there must be consideration before because working and learning are the side that is difficult to put together. As a college student, I don't agree if college students have a part time job. Especially if the students who ca not manage their time well. because it only can broke focus of their self in studying. Moreover, it is so difficult to balance both studying and working. Consequently, one of their choices will become victim. So, the students cannot studying as well as usual. When they have a problem, of course it will affect on the other side. Even though they give reason working to get experience, surely there must be consideration before because working and learning are the side that is difficult to put together.\", 'Part time job activates the people in their work. These people do not waste time so they also remain healthy. In the part time job people remain busy in their work so they build their nation attitude and build a strong country. Our leader Quid-e-Azam said do and do their work so that you are not so much time to criticize. Otherwise doing part time job you may help others people with money, do their work and help them. To some extent part time job has some losses. With so much work you may suffer in fever. Often people do part time job to earn money for their family. In Pakistan over all people remaining free and do nothing instead of criticise other so i say part time job is very necessary part of life. It will make them busy who try to criticise others. They would be helpful for their country. Part time job is some thing tiresome. People doing part time job suffer from mental and physical distortion and fatigue. It is negative in a sense that it affects regular job as well. Mental tension is created by studying and teaching at the same time. Part time job has its positive and negative points.', \"In my opinion, Part - Time Work is a job in which an employee does not work full in hours or not a permanent job. So it stated like that because we don't have to do it like a serious stuff not like study. However, I think having a job is important but I will suggest someone that want to work part time job that don't overdo it, but working is necessary to gain experience before graduating from university. Many students work part time jobs to supply themselves with additional funds. Working part time is ideal for students, since it allows them to balance their academic needs with their school needs. Often, a school will provide a list of available part time jobs for the benefit of students, and many college towns deliberately tailor their openings for students. They don't have a lot of hope for the future, except that it won't get worse. I support that if we want to help family and pay extra we have to do part time job. For example, if parents pay 5000 baht per month, have to pay for dormitory for 2500 baht, we have only 2500 baht to spend. We have to eat and pay for many things. We shouldn't ask with parents more. We should find job to reduce the money from parents. They will not tired to work because they are old.\", \"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In college, most students have part-time job in order to pay something, such as eat, transportation and so on. On the other hands, foreign books are very expensive. It costs about NT 1000. So far, I have part-time job. I think I had learned a lot from the part-time job. For instance, I improve my communication skill and get more self-confident. In 2009, every countries had faced economic recession, many people lost job. Maybe family faced that difficult problem. Due to deal with the problem, students have to get a par-time job. The situation is very common in global economic recession. If students have a part-time job, it can decrease parent's hard things. Everyone knows high education is most expensive. Having a part-time job reduces parent's burden and increase experience. Finally, I agree with having a part-time job in college. It is not only to earn money but also to learn a lot. We can make a lot of friends in different field. Getting a part-time job has a lot advantages if you deal with time management. If you are good at time management, having a part-time job is a good choice in college.\", \"I think there are several reasons it is important for university students to get a part-time job, and I outline two of them below. The first is that part-time jobs are a valuable way to see how what students have learnt in class applies in the real world. Classroom education, especially at the university level, tends to be academic and theory-oriented. There is often little opportunity to see how these theories apply in practical usage. A part-time job in the same field as the student's degree will allow them to learn from professionals who apply these concepts on a daily basis. This will be a useful contrast from university classes, which are almost always taught by researchers. The second benefit of obtaining part-time employment alongside higher education is that it gives the student opportunities to pick up skills that they will need later when they enter the workforce, but are not taught in traditional university curricula. These include interpersonal skills and effective communication. University education is primarily designed to test whether the theoretical concepts taught have been learnt with sufficient clarity. When students enter the workforce, however, they often need to apply these concepts in concert with their colleagues. This will require them to communicate effectively and clearly. A part-time job will definitely give them an opportunity to exercise and improve this set of skills.\", \"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons why it is important. First of all, In order to maintain their livelihood. There is many students who under difficult. We can't live if you do not eat something. If there is no energy, no life can live. Second reason is conversation skill. It is very important because we need social skill in social. We should talk to other people what you need. It will learn from real life rather than learning. I believe that this help to prove this skill in Part-time job. When it is important you do not tell, cannot get what you need. You can continue to say that the opportunity is at part time job. And last reason is Univ. Major. I hope that if you want to have a part time job, consider what your major is and what kind of part time job will help us. For example my case, my major is English literature. To study English and to level up my, I will find kind of part time job which is related English. As these reason, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.\", \"As a college student, we aren't very busy so that we can spend a lot of time in doing the things we like. Some students do sports, such as playing football, running. Some students play computer games, such as dota, dnf. Some students read books, such as novels, poetry. What I think the most important thing we should do in the free time is doing a part-time job. College is an important place connecting school and society. We do not only learn knowledge here, but also learn experience which we can't learn from class. So having a part-time job can solve this problem. In fact, a part-time job can make our college life substantially. From the part-time job, we can learn how to deal with work problem, how to work with others. We can also develop good habit. What is the most important; we can understand how hard the making money is, so that we can make a good preparation for the later life. College life is colorful, so we don't need to study too hard as senior high school. We should learn to allocate our time and know what we really need. Having a part-time job is important to us; it's not only an opportunity, but also a challenge.\", \"Is important for college students to have a part-time job? I think that has much opinion to answer it. The part-time job is a job that can do in partial time. So the college student can do part-time job when they has spare time (if they want). There are many reasons why the college student do part-time job (if they do). The first are they need more money to having fun, pay the studying cost, etc. the second are they need to get job experiences for the future. College students need more money if they need it, because sometimes that the college student's money that given from their parent are not enough to solve it. So they will search a part-time job. Why part-time job? Because their study time can't be compromised with the regular job and they will need a part-time job that has unusual work time. So they can combine their studying with working in a part-time job. After the college students graduate from their university, it will be difficult to search a job. Because the Company that need worker will ask the job experiences related with the new job. So if they have not any experiences, they will be difficult to search job. So, job experiences from part-time job will be very helpful. I prefer to agree with the statement that college students must have a part-time job. It will give you an experiences about the future after you graduation, except if you didn't plan to work in the future.\", \"In my opinion, to get part-time job to do in daily life is a good choice. Some of student in universities want money for educating. Most of these students don't have enough money for learning, so part-time jobs help them waste less money. Some of students want money for buying something they want. That's a good thing because it's mean they don't use their parent's money for something they prefer and that things will meant for them. From the part, I can see that part-time jobs have many benefits. But in the other hands, there aren't all kind of part-time jobs are good. There are also jobs that dangerous for students, especially, for girls. For example, some of girls are waitress in pubs. Of course, it's very dangerous for the innocent girls. But these kinds of job can give them much money and faster. Even though you work in restaurant, if you have bad friends, there are terrible things waiting for you too. So many parents won't let their children do part-time jobs. But I think that anything has their own pros. and cons., so it's up to any person for choosing their own lives. The most important thing, everybody should have their own right thoughts. Do anything you think that it's the best way. But don't forget to ask your parents and trust them because they exactly know the best thing for you.\", \"When students are available from school, it is a good idea to have part time job. The benefits for having part time jobs are as follows. Firstly, students have extra money for school. Students can help family to support themselves by earning money from part time job. There are some places that students can do part time job when they are free during the weekend or weekend such as cinema, food shops, passengers and etc. Many students can have income when being as college students that is very good to do because they will be very proud themselves. The extra money can also support their family because some of them may have some problem about financial. Many students have to drop school so they must help themselves. Second, experience, of course that gaining experience is important. In a present, many company require students to have experience so a student that got experience is better than non-experience. Last, making new friends. This is a small part but I think it's interesting to have new friends in part time job. We can share our knowledge and share other experience. We learn and understand each other. It make us to be friendly and easy going. So I think not just only three points, but many points to have part time job.\", \"Many college students have experiences doing part-time jobs. Some of them even spend most of their leisure time doing part-time jobs. I think doing part-time jobs is really important for college students. By doing part-time jobs, students can learn what they can't get from school. For example, they broaden their field of visions by having more chances to get along with different people. Second, they learn to have sense of responsibility by taking charge of jobs. Third, they make friends with people from different places, which make their college time more interesting and substantial. Nevertheless, college students can't have a part-time job without concentrating on their studies. Although i think that having the experiences of part-time jobs is important, learning by studies is the most important thing for college students. If students spend most of their time doing a part-time job, they will miss the chance to enjoy campus life, and precious memories. To make matters worse, they may fail in examinations. To sum up, college students should first do their best on studies. Besides, they should participate in activities in school like clubs. Experiences of clubs are useful for improving abilities of leadership, and thus helpful for applying jobs after graduating. Only if they still have time, they can have a part-time job and enjoy their college life.\", \"As one of college students, I agree to the statement, It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have 3 reasons to support this opinion. Firstly, for students to learn how to manage money. College students don't have much money, but have lots of time. So they tend to use it too much. They're not good at control it. If they work, they'll recognize the importance and value of money. And they're going to get responsibility against money. So they will never waste it. In the near future we college students have our own family. We have to manage money all on our own. We should independent and how to control as soon as possible. Secondly, for students to know the society. Now, in university, lots of students are so lazy. Some are always late for school, some often sleep during the class and so on. Thanks to having a part-time job, they can know the responsibility against their task. There're many differences between college and society. In the society, rules are much stricter than college. If they don't know the society at all, they may not be able to be hired because of bad manner. So for students, a part-time job is one of good opportunities to practice for the future. Lastly, for companies to save money. Now in Japan, the economic situation is not good. And the companies hire less people than usual. So they're in trouble because of lack of staff. If companies hire general people, they have to pay much money. But for students, the pay is only about 800 yen per hour. Companies must want to hire students more than general people. In conclusion, I think college students should get a part-time job both for students and for companies.\", 'In the college, there are many activities to do such as learning subjects, doing researches, making appointments, testing quizzes, reading papers, etc. The college student should do activities in the college because they will be helped the student can learn, play and work together appropriately. Some department of the student college is hard to pass graduated and get good grades. Because the student may spend many time or share time in period. That is not the college period such as weekend, holiday, long holiday, Sunday, etc. They might divide time properly and use time co together with the other such as friends, teacher, place, etc, In my opinion, having a part-time in Thailand is not important for every college students. The student should do main tasks and there are many activities before more than have a part-time job in student lifestyle. If you have the certainly free-time, you may do a part-time job. I think just only do activities of the student department and college, it is enough for the college student so It is not necessary for having a part-time job in the college student. Part-time job, it can do every time but tasks and activities in the college may do only once or certainly time. Part-time may make you waste your effective progress in the student college.', \"I agree with this statement because I think they can prepare many things which are important after graduating through a part-time job. They can learn what they are good at and how to speak to others. They can understand what they are good at or not. There are some types of part-time job, teaching, delivering, cooking, customer service and so on. Home teacher, say, is a typical job for college students. Those who have no idea of his/her future may want to be a teacher through home teachers. Or, if those who want to be a teacher may change his/her dream because he/she realizes him/herself not good at teaching. So it's a good chance for college students to know themselves. Next, it is important to speak politely when we speak to others such as boss, strange people and so on. Only spending their time in college, they almost speak to friends and they have few chances that they have to speak politely. So in order to learn how to speak to others, it is valuable for college student to have a part-time job. So as I said, they can learn what they can do and how important to be polite is thorough a part-time job.\", 'If students work part time work to make random the schedule and work is not illegal. It also made good time to befit. Because most students may not be as good. Depends on the money home and working part time as part of helping alleviate the burden of home and training to recognize their responsibility. The money is about saving some student want to be different of China has bought not just money being home some students and sleeping rooms are merely. I think find a job as department stores or facilities do use the time to practice the benefits of their own saving in time of need. Working part time, we will know the responsibility of having to work more or less. But a stand must see that work to be done manually it is appropriate or not. But if work is not appropriate to themselves will result in work out bad or abusive. Part time jobs that are both heavy and light has both advantages and disadvantages, if interested in part time, if done too much may result in lessons. Working part time because most of the work very late to quit, resulting so no time to read a books and rest. Therefore, is it necessary to work part time students, if students know the best time to divide.', \"I agree with this opinion. There are some reasons. First, it is important for college students to learn how difficult it is to earn money. If students don't have a part-time job and they only study and enjoy their free time, they never experience the importance of earning money. Second, they can meet a lot of people through a part-time job. In their college, people who come to the college are almost same age. Probably, there are another college student, or woman who have children, or people from other region etc. Those who can know many things that you don't know or you don't learn at your college. So you can learn not only at school but also at a place you work. Third, if you experience many kind of works through a part-time job, you can learn what it is about working. And you can image how you want to work. The time that you are college students is only a few years, but you must prepare for future before graduate college. So having a part-time job is very important. I think that having a part-time job is as important as studying in college. If students spend much more time on part-time job and they can't have enough time to study, they should reduce the time that they spend on part-time job.\", \"I am a student completing a full-time degree and working a part-time job out of necessity because my parents do not have enough money to pay for all of my tuition and I wasn't fortunate enough to receive a scholarship although, I applied for several. Since starting work, I can honestly say that I am more confident, I manage my time a lot better than any of my classmates and I seem to have gained a certain level of respect from people that I wasn't aware of before. It is difficult at times, especially during exams, but I have been pretty lucky because I have a very understanding boss who goes out of his way to help me in any way that he can. I know my money situation has improved, no surprises there but I also don't stress out as much as some of my mates do when the pressure is on. I think that the way I think about and approach tasks has improved a lot and I make use of a few mini systems that my boss helped me create which allow me to break my tasks down into smaller chunks. I can only say that it has helped me and I feel a lot better within myself. So, I really do think that all students should get a part-time job if not for the money, then just for the extra skills that they can get while being paid to do so.\", 'In my opinion, I am strongly agree with the idea that, it is important for our college students to have a part-time job. Now we can see everywhere that student take part –jobs like private teacher, seller and so on. So why they do these jobs? What advantages benefit us? I think the main reason is money. With the improvement of our living standards, a lot of study material are expensive than before. Then the student has to do some jobs to reduce considerable financial pressure. By doing so, we can also have the ability to travel or buy some items we like. We also hope that through this way, we can no longer dependent on our parents. In addition, we can also accumulate some social experience. From kindergarten to high school, what we learned is totally the knowledge from books. In this way, it does a lot benefits to our future jobs. In a word, there are many advantages for our college students to do some jobs. Not only make money, but also develop our independence. So if you a lot of free time after class, try to look for a part-time job and you will not regret about it.', \"I disagree with that. To be sure, to have a part-time to live is vital for college students. But it isn't good to earn money to play. Generally speaking, college students have more free time than high school students and junior high school students. And how to use their time all depends on them. Many college students spend a lot of time working part-time because they need to earn money to play with friends. Making many friends in college is good, however, and studying is also important. In college, there are many things to do for them, for example, taking part in an internship, a club, a seminar, and so on. So, college students should challenge actively what they can do only in college. By challenging a lot, they are able to their best with confidence when they work in the future. Wages of a part-time job are very low generally, and working part-time is very tiring for college students. So, it costs them much time and effort to get money in working part-time. As a result, they can't often concentrate on a class and study for a test in college often. It is not good for them. Therefore, I don't think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.\", \"I find it hard to make a generalisation on whether it's important or not for college students to have a part-time job, because this seems like something very individual and highly dependent on the individual student and their circumstances. Jobs serve a few main functions: to earn money, to gain experience, to get a head-start in a career, and to have something to do. Whether or not it's important for a given college student to have a part-time job would thus be dependent on how important those various factors are for them. A poor student, for instance, would find a (paying) job beneficial or even necessary to meet their financial needs, and would find such a job to be more important for them than it would be for a rich student who does not have to worry about finances. Alternatively, a student might take up a job to gain experience and expand their horizons beyond the merely academic, and consider this an important pursuit. Another student might, however, find the time spent on a job to be better spent on their college work, studying and getting the best grades they can, so as to be able to (ideally) get a better job in future. Yet another student might wish to enjoy their last few years of freedom before entering the workforce, and find it more important to have free time to spend on leisure, rather than on a job. A final hypothetical student might meanwhile be already struggling with their college work (with or without additional commitments), and getting a job would further jeopardise their ability to cope. As such, while having a part-time job would be important for some college students, this assertion cannot be universally applied to all of them. \", \"As we all know, some college students have part-time jobs to support their life in college, and other students spend their parents' money to live their life. Many times it's hard for us to say who is right or who is wrong. But in social opinion, also in my opinion, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. Firstly, having part-time jobs to support college students' life in college can reduce their parents' financial burden. Our parents are no longer giving money to us or give less money to us. It can save the whole family's expenses. Secondly, having part-time jobs can develop our ability. If we have a part-time job, we will know the society or interpersonal relationship better, and we may make friends with more people. It's useful for our future work. In other words we can prepare for our future. In a word, working opens our eyes. Finally, using the money that earned by ourselves, will make us feel great. We all know that food made by ourselves tastes more delicious, the house built by ourselves live more comfortable. As the same way, the money earned by ourselves spends more fulfilling. No matter you live in a poor family or rich family or well-off family, having part-time jobs can help you in many ways. So it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.\", 'I agree that college students should have a part-time job because the expenses of college or higher education have grown at an alarming rate over the past few years. This has compelled many college students to look for the part time jobs, which involve working for a few hours and attending college lectures once the work gets over. Though there are some negative aspects of part time jobs for college students like over exertions and some sort of tensions, these jobs provide the students with the much needed experience which comes handy while studying courses like management, engineering and accounts. Given below are some exciting part time entry level jobs for college students. A part-time job can help you pay for living expenses, including housing, food, books, gas, and clothes. Since you will eventually have to pay off any school-related loans that you take out, it is best to take out as little as possible. Working part-time during college will build your character. Most of the jobs available to college students are very humbling. After you experience life as a waitress, or a janitor, or a sales clerk, you will become that much more grateful for the opportunities that a college education will provide you in the future. You will realize that the world does not exist to wait on you hand and foot, and that if you want to get something, you have to give something first.', 'Nowadays, more and more college student took part-time jobs in their spare time as salesmen, waiters or shop assistants. They are engaged in part-time jobs because they want to earn some tuition to help their family in the meantime to have work experiences. People wonder whether it is good for students to do so. Some people are afraid that taking a part-time job will spend their too much time. It will influence their study. Some people disagree with them, they think it will be a good way to make young students know that how hard to earn the money and get the experience from it. To have a part-time job becomes a hot topic, today. In my view, I agree with the latter, firstly, students can earn some money from the part-time jobs to help their family. Second, we can learn a lot from it, and get the chance to show how much we have learned from the school. Last but not least, a part-time job can train our ability of working, cooperation and getting along with others. In the word, get a part-time job is not only good for earn money but also in study and ability! So if you have chance, try to get a part-time job.', \"Lots of problems exist in part time job. I would like to discuss low wage, behavior of superior, and no break time during work. I have done part time job in Korea the time I was working these three problems caused me lots of stress when I was at work the manager treated me bad he swore at me and shouted at me in front of people, At the work break time was not guaranteed if the manager see me moving slowly he told me to walk faster or to run, of course the wage was not so good and I didn't get paid in proper date. Behavior of manager or superior at the work in work, I heard bad news more than good news. In my case as I said. Manager used to swore at part time job workers. This problem should be fixed as soon as possible because part time job workers has personality too they do not deserve that my onion is relationship between part time job worker and superior should be improved for good. The second problem is break time is not guaranteed. Human kind requires food, sleep, etc.. To live a keep up but at the part time job work employers want worker to work until shift is done that might increase the incest but that is the good way to lose people\", \"Nowadays many students have a part-time job for their colleges' tuition. So it's going to be a problem because we have to do it especially private school. I think it is important for us however there are many shortages. First, we are student. The most important part to us is study. The chance of part-time job is always around you however the chance of study is not around you. For instance, there is someone who has started studying late. They thought part-time job is more important than study but they realized that study have to do in proper time. Therefore part-time job is not important than study. Second, we cannot concentrate on class. Generally, we usually do part-time job from the evening to the late at night. Therefore we cannot concentrate our class because of sleepiness. For example, I did night delivery service from 10:00pm to 6:00am. It is so hard in the first day, but I adapted to the environmental change so I slept during classes. Therefore part-time job disturb the concentration on class. Consequently, part-time job is become the social problem. Many news castings report it as the social problem. So the Government adopts a wise policy to concentrate study. The problem only can resolve from the Government because it's a hot potato for college students. We have to study for our future and part-time job is not the first.\", \"I think have part-time job experiences for students in their college life are important. In my opinions, first, most of students don't have to leave their hometown and don't have to do every thing by themselves before they become freshmen. As became a freshman, students might have to leave their hometown far for good university and parents might tell them that you should deal with everything by yourself include your costs for live. So this is definitely a good chance to training them. Second, they can learn a lot of rules and professional knowledge about the job and methods for make friends by having part-time job experience. It is useful for training them and makes their world wider. Besides, friends who known in part-time job might be important in their future. For instance, in part-time job, they might find their best friend even soul mate, and can find friends or bosses that can give a hand in their futures job as they meet some difficult. When doing part-time job or the life in the university it can be look as a little society, so before enter the real society, it can be a good chance to practice and find fault to make themselves more sophisticated. I think having part-time job experiences might make it easier and useful for students to find good jobs.\", \"There are three reason why I agree that a college student should have a part time job. First of all, They will learn how to manage the money effectively. With worked as a part time, they will get more money and they can commute their parent's burden with help to pay their school. It is not only money that the student must be able to manage effectively. The student will learn how to manage time too. They will learn to divide their time between work and study. This way, they become an expert in time management if they can balancing part time work with their studies. So, all their time won't be wasted because of doing activity that is not too important or not productive. And the last, the student will get more friends outside the university. It can be hard to meet people when at university or at least a different crowd of people. But If you work outside the university, you will meet lots of new people, making new friends which can be refreshing when university becomes a bit stale and suffocating. Some people may disagree with me, but I believe there are more benefits for people who work part time while studying.\", 'I think part time job is very good to student. I will write about why. First, it can earn my own money. We can use that for eating, shopping or enjoy your time. And I can help my mother for my university registration fee. Second, it can help to your society experience. It will help you that how to do at your company and how to face your boss. Also you can make friends at work. I can save my money for the future and to buy my parent birthday gift if I save them monthly, not depend on my parent to be grown up. Now days university fee is very expensive too so that is why students look for part time job. Another reason is society experience many people graduate with no social experience that can be problem adjusting to the working company. To face boss it take a lot of brave mind because boss can fire you anytime. At school we have friend and work we can make friend too make friend at work can help me adopting to work and teach me how to work well. These reasons are why I agree to do part time job', \"In my opinion, I think that take the part time job while be a college student is very important thing to do, because the part time job give a lot of experience and necessary skills that we have to use when we are an employer, labor or boss. The part time job will teach you that what you should do when you are in the part of company and it will teach how to change yourself to be like others. The part time job gives you an important thing that is you must com on time, because time is the important thing for the world of works. If you come to work late, it means you are make a serious problem to your organizations, so time is the important thing and you can not disagree that the part time job is not important for college students because the experience will gain from perform. It's not gain for trading or shop, so the experiences are similar with the boxes golden that you have to find and find it to make your box full, but the box of experiences does not the day of full, experience can increase anytime and anywhere if you want to do. Last the part time job is important for college student. Because it can make you be a perfect man.\", \"I agree the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have the following reasons to explain my idea. College students need not only to learn knowledge of books, but also to practice in universities. College students have a part-time job, which are interests. College students can make their knowledge learning from books practiced by home teaching, and they can get the living experience through a part-time job. They can find out their shortcoming and advantages. A part-time job is good for college students' growth. For example, these people's achievements that also experienced the living of a university prove that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In college age, they go through the living of a part-time job, and all respects of their abilities are raised. They become more confident of themselves and they have great powers to work. So the reasons above show explain my thought. I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. That is good for the developing of college students. So if you have a chance to have a part-time job, try to get it and work hard. You will get the advantages.\", 'In situation like this days. Ours teenager could be find new ways of income to save our money. But doing part-time jobs has more reasons to do it. Every person have reason to do part-time jobs. Some person do it for find a new experience or find new salary to use in his duty. They have many reasons to do part-time job. In my opinion I think do part-time job is good for everyone. Because we find a new kinds of experience and give ourselves to know haw hard we can find money and teach me about the value of money. We could find a new friend when you doing a part-time job. Part-time job make me more conscious amd sociable. It is like training before going to the real world. Anothers reasons is some person want to saving money to buy the gadgets like cloth, shoes and the others by his own. In my opinion doing part-time job like this way is good. Because you use your money to by thing that you want. This way is help your parents saving money. Nevertheless doing part-time job in my opinion have only the utilities it can not harm you. It only make you stronger and stronger.', \"Some people think that teenagers have part-time job is bad. Because they think part-time job is a cause of their low grade. And they even think that the teenagers who do the part-time job are a delinquent student. But I think they are prejudiced. They can learn about economic strength. Besides, part time job has some benefits for teenager. So, in my opinion, teenagers having a job when they are still students are a good way of learning about society. Here are some reasons that why I agree for the teenagers having their jobs. 1 First, teenagers can know the value of money is worth as they earn money themselves. Most of the teenagers and children get pocket money from their parents. But they do anything in order to have money. They don't know how much they worked, and where does the money come from. If they have part-time jobs, they can know about it. So, part-time jobs can help the teenagers to take care of their money. Second, they can learn about many people and economic. For example, teens working in some place like'Starbucks', they can see a lot of kinds of people. Some people are younger than them, but many other people are older than them. They can learn saying, ideas, and attitudes. By doing this, they can be established right values. There are many good places where teenagers can work: convenience stores, fast food restaurants, parking assistants, etc. Teenagers can learn worthwhile things through their part-time jobs in a way they cannot through textbooks, doing assignments. Therefore, I agree with teenagers' job.\", \"I agree that it is important for college students to have apart-time job. Nowadays, a large number of college students are having a part-time job. Some of them hold that part-time jobs can help them to adapt to the society well and give them many experiences. Take a friend of mine for example, when Lily was a college student, she went to supermarket as a promoter or went to be a family teacher every weekend. Then owing to her experiences, she quickly got a good job after graduating from university. in the other students' opinions, they think that they can buy goods they want their parents cannot afford. I know a student that he goes to a restaurant as a waiter at his part-time to earn enough money what a computer needs. Thus, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, our parents always don't agree us to get part-time jobs. They are afraid that our study and safety. In my opinion, having a good part-time job is good for students. We should pay attention to the advantages of part-time jobs and make the most of them. Meanwhile, we should learn to get knowledge from the part-time jobs and make them a helpful tool for our development.\", \"I think the college student's part-time job is important. Because of the tuition is getting higher. But all the parents get in trouble pay all the tuition. They are difficult to afford all the tuition for four years. So almost students have responsible for help their parents. But someone who the not rich is thinking I don't need to have a part-time job then the person isn't needed to have part-time job. Because doing the part-time job is optional. Not duty. But I think the person go to college should better have part-time job in every considered situation. First, they can help their parents who feel difficult to pay for their son's or daughter's tuition for four years. Of course, the money their earned can't fill all the tuition. But the money is not only touchable money. That is mind for their parents. And the money their earned can use their allowance. We can see this like small. But this is proud and big for them. I also agree this. Anyway, the second is they can go through out of the college. That is important. It is easy to people who go to college thinking I'm a just student. But college students are not just student. College is a one of the small society. So college students are members of society. So I think college student's part-time job is important.\", \"It is not important for college student to have a part-time job as it may not offer what is required for the students. Whether a not college students need the job is dependent on their financial needs and also their priorities. College life may have long breaks in between the semesters which serve as a very timely period for doing a part-time job which can finance the students' expenses or luxurious spending such as getting a new smart phone or accessories. Students who have other priorities such as getting good grades or having a better portfolio would rather spend time doing an internship in a company or to prepare for the upcoming modules they have to take. For students who are financially burdened, a part-time job is important for them to fulfil their daily needs. However, for those who are not, it can merely serve as a mean to fill their excess time and it also comes with monetary reward. Some may argue that working part-time can help a college student manage their time more effectively, especially if the part-time job is done regularly during semester period as there will be lesser time spare for the student to do their academic work. However, having a co-curricular activity or taking up a leadership position in various groups can better enhance the students' college life. Therefore, I believe that the importance of having a part-time job for students in college is not necessary unless by circumstances or by the needs that the students have to satisfy. \", \"I agree with it is important for college students to have a part time job. As we know, the cost for college student is too much (in this case, we can say expensive). It's easy if the parent from that students is rich people. But, how about the students with contrary condition? So, part time job its better solution for this situation. The student can help the parent to don't lost the cost too much. In the other hand, the students have new experience beside their daily activity(studying). The students must be smart to split their time. Because they add new activity for their time, studying and have a part time job. It's proudly can get their money by themselves than they must ask money from their parents as requirements in college. In my opinion, they are independent student. If all college students do that, I think the parents don't worry about financial problem. And for that student, it can be a start before they work at company after they graduate from that college. Maybe we can say its training to get a new skill for a job. So it's positive think for that student. In this era, nothing to say shine for do a something. If we can, why not? We can learn from college student who have a part time job. They get money with themselves, so they help they parents. And I think they make proud their parent with what they are doing.\"]\n"
